Tension of a Spinning Ring
fun with physics

What is the tension in a spinning ring, for example Bank's orbitals or a Niven Ring?

Let us break the ring into _N_ sections. The angle (in radians) subtended by each section, dθ, is 2π / _N_. Suppose the radius of the ring is _R_ and the mass-per-unit-length of the ring is λ; then the mass of a section is λ _R_ dθ and the mass of the whole ring _M_ = 2π_R_λ.

Ignoring gravity, there a…

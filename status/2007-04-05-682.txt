genpasswd

    #!/bin/sh
    # genpasswd.sh
    #   Generate a random password with almost
    #   144 bits of randomness, making use of
    #   /dev/random.
    # Note:
    #   Most online services have somewhat
    #   arbitrary rules about what characters
    #   can be included in a password. So we
    #   limit ourselves to A-Za-z0-9.

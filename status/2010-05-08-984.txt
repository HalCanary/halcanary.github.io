simple mergesort

Even though I've studied this algorithm a couple of times, I've never had to implement it before. So I assigned it to myself.

    /** should have a time-complecity of O(N×log(N))
        and a space-compelcity of O(N) **/
    void mergesort(int N, int array[]) {
      int k; // k is the block size.
      int x; //x is which block we are at.
      int i,j; //indices in old…

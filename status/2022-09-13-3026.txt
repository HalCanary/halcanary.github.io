Go exec function
Execute a program, causing the program that is currently being run to be replaced with a new program

The following

```go
func execv(cmd string, args ...string) error {
    path, err := exec.LookPath(cmd)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return syscall.Exec(
        path,
        append([]string{cmd}, args...),
        syscall.Environ())
}
```

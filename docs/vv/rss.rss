			<title>Italic and bold isolate characters for Unicode.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>a proposal</p>
<p>Unicode needs two new pairs of characters.  call them <code>‚ü™</code>, <code>‚ü´</code> and <code>‚ü¶</code>,
<code>‚üß</code> for this description, but their actual glyphs could be anything symmetric.</p>
<p>The string &quot;‚ü™foobar‚ü´&quot; would be defined to be semantically equivalent to the
italic version of &quot;foobar&quot;, i.e. &quot;ùëìùëúùëúùëèùëéùëü&quot;.</p>
<p>Similarly, the string &quot;‚ü¶foobar‚üß&quot; would be defined to be semantically
equivalent to the bold version of &quot;foobar&quot;, i.e. &quot;ùó≥ùóºùóºùóØùóÆùóø&quot;.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶A text shaper (e.g. Harfbuzz) could replace text between these symbols with
italic or bold text, if possible.</p>
<p>But when those italic or bold fonts are unavailable or you are in plain-text
mode (e.g. editing a computer program), then the new glyphs would be shown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/Lieutenant_Fusilier.jpg" alt="Lieutenant Fusilier" /><br />
Sergeant Theodora Fusilier, serial number 110552, is one of a hundred
thousand machines that share her name, line soldiers in the army of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Beyond. She was designed to carry a
laser musket, protect human space from alien threats, follow the orders of
her human officers, and be happy to do so.</p>
<p>But Dora's always been a rather ambitious machine‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Set in the same universe as <em>Maid to Love You</em>. Expect worldbuilding that
doesn't try to make sense, laser muskets, adorable robots, and possibly
some lewd bits.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>summary of last few years of site changes.</p>
<p>I now host this site on Github, since it is free and fairly easy for me to use.
I push the new version of the site with a simple <code>git push</code>.  I only pay for my
domain name.</p>
<p>I am still using the same blog builder Python script I wrote years ago, but
I've refactored it a dozen times.  I also use a similar script to rebuild
static pages from markdown source too.</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Colors are either default or white-on-black for dark mode.  Information
that I used to de-emphasize with grey-on-white text is now put in a
box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch from original-flavor Markdown to CommonMark.  Allows me to put
markdown inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;foobar&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;

&gt; Foo
&gt; Bar

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button onclick=&quot;document.getElementById('foobar')
                         .style
                         .display = 'block';&quot;&gt;
SHOW
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce extra resources needed by a page:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;</code> is now a <code>data:</code> URL.</li>
<li>I inline all CSS.</li>
<li>I also inline a SVG version of my written name on the static pages as a banner.
Effort was made to minimize the size.  By vectorizing what was
originally a scanned image, it is much smaller and looks really good on
high-dpi screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting to try to meet accessibility standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace <code>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot; onlick=&quot;....&quot;&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, since that is less of
an abuse of html.  It is more clear to the user that clicking that will
change something on the page, not go to a new page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove extraneous content from main page.</p>
</li>
</ul>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>adding dark mode to this site.</p>
<p>I added a <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {...}</code> block to this site's CSS. The tough part was to make the SVG fill color respect that.  But it turns out that if you just style the svg element with</p>
<pre><code>svg {
    fill: currentColor;    
}
</code></pre>
<p>and remove all style information in the SVG itself, then it works as expected.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Remembering my uncle.</p>
<p>My father's sister's husband, my Uncle Ranny, passed away earlier this year. Even though I never spent much time with him, when I did get to visit him, he was always kind and nice to talk to.</p>
<p>When Ranny Church told me that his uncle was Alonzo Church of the Church-Turing thesis and the lambda calculus, I though he was joking about the fact that I was studying computer science and that he happened to share a last name with one of the fathers of theoretical computer science.  But in fact, he wasn't joking.  My uncle's uncle was <em>the</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church (1903-1995)</a>, son of Samuel Robbins Church and Mildred Hannah Parker Church, Ranny's grandparents.  I should take people at their word more often.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legacy.com/amp/obituaries/washingtonpost/196007855">Randolph Warner Church Jr. (1934-11-06 ‚Äì 2020-03-24)</a></p>
<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Randolph Warner Church Jr. &quot;Ranny,&quot; age 85, died March 24, 2020 at Westminster Canterbury of the Blue Ridge in Charlottesville after a long struggle with Parkinson's Disease. Born in Richmond, Virginia on November 6, 1934, he was the oldest son of the late Randolph Warner Church Sr. and the late Elizabeth Lewis Gochnauer Church. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Richmond in 1953 where he played on the state championship tennis team. He was also active in the Boy Scouts, earning the rank of Eagle Scout. In 1957 he received a B.A. with honors in political science from the University of Virginia. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, the Raven Society and T.I.L.K.A. He lettered in tennis and in 1957 was the University's lightweight intramural boxing champion. He was Sports Editor of the Cavalier Daily, Editor of the Virginia Spectator, and Managing Editor of the Virginia Law Weekly. In 1960 he received an LL.B. From the University of Virginia and joined the Fairfax firm, McCandlish, Lillard, Marsh &amp; Van Dyck, in which he became a partner in 1963. He served as Managing Partner from 1972 until 1983. In 1984 he became a partner in the Richmond law firm Hunton &amp; Williams and with four other lawyers opened its Northern Virginia office where he served as Managing Partner until his retirement in 1999. Ranny was active in civic affairs, serving on the Board of Visitors of George Mason University from 1982-1990 and as its Rector from 1983-86. He was a member of the board of the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra and its executive committee and served as its general counsel. He was on the boards of the Symphony's foundation, Virginia FREE, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Foundation. From 1994-2000 he was a member of the Board of the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, serving as its Vice President. In 1999 he brought together several interests to create &quot;Fall for the Book,&quot; a major Virginia book festival, now in its 21st year. He was its first president, and remained on the board until 2018. He also served as a member of the Board of Directors for the Parkinson's Foundation of the Metropolitan D.C. Area and was treasurer of that organization from 2012 to 2014. He served on the board of George Mason Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries, George Mason Bank and George Mason Mortgage Company. In 1985 his social fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon gave him an award as an outstanding alumnus. He was also a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. Ranny's publications include Appellate Civil Litigation (Charlottesville, 1984), Randolph Warner Church (1907-1984) A Sketch, Pembroke Gochnauer (1841-1919): A Southern Soldier's Story, This Our Life: A View of America (1863-1924), and Travels With Ran: On the Road with Ranny Church (1956-2016). Ranny will be remembered as a Renaissance man: intelligent, knowledgeable, literate, athletic, and social. He is survived by his devoted wife of nearly 50 years, Lucy Canary Church. Together they worked in many political and cultural activities, particularly in support of the arts and George Mason University where they endowed two scholarships. They shared a love of college basketball, football and travel, visiting every continent and more than 110 countries. Additional survivors include their daughter, Leslie Pennell (Mark) of Cincinnati OH, three grandchildren, Ranny's two brothers, John Armistead Church (Phyllis) of Princeton Junction NJ, and Marshall Robbins Church (Priscilla Hoobler) of Philomath OR, and a sister, Mary Armistead Church Kent (Joe) of Richmond. A memorial celebration of Ranny's life will be held at a later date, and his ashes will be placed in the Columbarium at the University of Virginia Cemetery. A memorial celebration of Ranny's life will be held at a later date, and his ashes will be placed in the Columbarium at the University of Virginia Cemetery.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A list of things that we should be seriously working on</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clarify and extend meaning of &quot;republican form of government&quot; in Article Four:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Affirmative right to vote and access to voting systems for all adult citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure, transparent, secret ballot voting systems with independent statistical tests for accuracy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A refinement of O&#39;Neill&#39;s colonies.</p>
<p><a href="https://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArtHiRes/70sArt/art.html"><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/Spacecolony1.jpg" alt="[Interior view, O'Neill cylinder, looking out through large windows. NASA ID# AC75-1086]" /></a></p>
<p>Start with the idea of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O'Neill cylinder</a>: a spinning cylindrical space habitat 8 km in diameter and 32 km long.  The frequency of revolution is about two minutes.  This is a good diameter for a space habitat: if it is an order of magnitude larger, the structure won't hold together when it spins; an order of magnitude smaller, the Coriolis force is more noticeable.</p>
<p>The giant windows are a huge hazard for both radiation and meteor impacts.  Instead, make the cylinder a solid steel vessel, thick enough to block most radiation.  Make it out of many layers of steel sheeting, with a thick layer of ablative insulation on the outside that can absorb and redirect the kinetic energy of a meteor impact.  Construct it as several independent 8 km long segments, each with its own shielded endcaps, all sharing a common axis.  Each hab segment has airlocks at the axis, leading to rotating joints that connect the segment to two small non-rotating modules at the axis, where there are ports for visiting spacecraft to dock.  This is also where arrays of directional communication antennas are located.</p>
<p>At one end of the axis, there is a massive array of solar panels (not rotating with the hab), at the other, there is an array of radiators.  If the hab is too far from a star for solar power, a nuclear power plant is located outside of the hab, along the axis, in its own shielded module, as far away as needed to minimize radiation hazards to humans entering and exiting the habitat at the docking port module.</p>
<p>The ecology and economy of the hab is 99.9% closed - with energy as an input and heat as an output.  Occasionally, robots are sent out to mine asteroids or comets for material to replace material losses.  I expect that the solar power and radiator arrays will need constant maintenance and replacement to keep working at 100% capacity.  All of the habs in a star system exchange information, allowing the occupants of the habs to share and trade art, science, and culture.</p>
<p>The inside of the hab segment is either completely open or is segmented into many smaller &quot;cells&quot; big enough to feel open but small enough to give the human population more room.  A cell might have a ceiling 100 meters tall that looks like Earth's sky and provides similar light.  Some of the interior volume is taken up by light industry and vertical-farm-based agriculture.</p>
<p>This design is meant to be very robust and adaptable.  It doesn't matter if the hab is located in orbit around a red dwarf or a blue giant, as long as the solar panels work.  The hab can be sent on a thousand-year interstellar voyage as long as enough spare energy and material is taken along.  The occupants of the hab can remotely supervise robots to build new habs.</p>
<p>This is the future for humanity if we don't become post-human.  There aren't any planets out there that we can walk around in shirtsleeves on.  Terraforming projects would take many thousands of years at best, and might fall afoul of the law of unintended consequences.  Even Mars, one of the best possible places for humans to live outside of Earth, might not have enough gravity for standard humans to thrive.</p>
<p>I'm not saying rocky planets and moons aren't useful.  After all, that's where a lot of the useable material is.  But if you need that material, why not supervise robot miners from orbit?  Especially if the planet has a surface gravity of 1.5g or a surface temperature of 700 K.</p>

			<title>Banking Manifesto</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I lay out a proposal to change the US banking system for the better.</p>
<p>Banks provide three essential services to the public:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Deposits.</strong> A place to keep money safe, with optional interest, allowing for 100% liquidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lending.</strong> Long-term loans to households and small businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transactions.</strong> Mechanisms for transferring money between entities such as wire transfers, checks, money orders, and credit cards transactions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any change to the banking system should perform those services better than the existing system.</p>
<p>Currently, depositors (those that put money into bank account) rely on government-guaranteed deposit insurance (the FDIC in America) to reduce risk to near zero.  Therefore, depositors don't choose between banks based on a risk-vs-interest calculation like an uninsured lender might. Instead, they only look at interest rates and the convenience that the bank offers.</p>
<p>In a risk-based sense, the depositor is loaning money to the FDIC, and the FDIC is loaning money to the bank (which then, in turn, makes long-term loans). In theory, the FDIC can withhold deposit insurance or charge higher premiums for banks likely to default.  It is the FDIC's job to keep banks honest.</p>
<p>Since there is no longer a connection between the bank's deposit business and its lending business, I propose spitting those into two businesses: deposit banks and lending banks.</p>
<p>The deposit banks can be nationalized and combined into a new publicly-owned entity called the Deposit Bank of the United States: DBUS.</p>
<p>DBUS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>provides deposit (savings + checking) accounts to all US citizens and legal entities that do business in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contracts with the Post Office for customer service tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides ATMs across the country for cash withdrawals.  Fees would be as low as possible: ATMs in post office lobbies would have a flat 0.1% fee.  ATMs in remote locations would charge higher rates to reflect additional cost of moving cash around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides cashier's checks with via ATMs with a built-in printer. The cashier's checks contain a digital signature, so stealing the printer and paper accomplishes nothing. The fee would be 0.1% plus the cost of the paper and ink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allows real-time payments between account-holders with a flat 0.1% fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>re-deposits all deposits (minus whatever amount they need for day-to-day operations) in a special interest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank. The Fed can set the interest rate as another way to control the economy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All deposits in DBUS are guaranteed by both the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>The FDIC no longer guarantees deposit accounts. Instead, they act as a publicly-owned ratings agency for lending banks.  The Fed now, based on the information provided by the FDIC, buys large amounts of bonds from the lending banks.  The Fed can also decide a bank is too large to fail and insist that is split in half before the Fed will resume buying bonds.</p>
<p>Nominally, the Fed can buy bank bonds in proportion to the amount of money in the DBUS account.  But if the economy needs more money to be created, they can buy more bonds.  If inflation is a worry, they can buy fewer.</p>
<p>Lending banks now only have two sources of money to lend: bonds and capital.  They no longer have to worry about a run on the bank.</p>
<p>Lending banks may also provide a line of credit to back a credit card.  But the card's payment system is managed by the DBUS.</p>
<p>Over time, regular checks and the ACH system would be phased out in favor of cashier's checks (now more convenient) and real-time payments.  Credit cards can also be phased out in favor of real-time payments.  For example, if your restaurant server brings you the bill and it has a QR-code on the bottom linking to a &quot;billing record&quot; in the DBUS database (which has an amount, a receiving account, and text metadata (your itemized receipt)).  You simply make a real-time payment into that billing record and your bill is paid.  The restaurant gets an instant notification that the bill is paid.</p>
<hr />
<p>Addendum:</p>
<p>In addition to providing deposit accounts that store US dollars, DBUS could also provide accounts that store stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments.  Such a system would allow a bond-issuer to pay all bond-holders instantly at the time the payment is due, without having to keep track of who owns the bonds, since DBUS's database can store that information.  Similarly for stocks and dividends.</p>
<p>DBUS could even allow some sets of accounts to be marked as &quot;tax-advantaged account groups&quot; and would report transactions into and out of that group to the IRS. This would allow households to control their own retirement accounts without having to go through a third party.</p>
<p>Finally, some transactions into a person's accounts can be marked as an &quot;income transaction&quot; and DBUS could use the records of those transactions to calculate that person's income tax obligation and even pay it automatically if the person chooses to.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, some of DBUS's full-service ATMs would allow bulk deposits of coins and bills.  If vending machines can do it, why can't an ATM?  Similarly, full-service ATMs should be able to give out currency in denominations other than 20 USD.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>another proposed change to our constitution</p>
<p>I'd like to propose a four-part election to replace our current system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Application</strong> On day one of the campaign, eligible citizens can apply for
the office, at the local, state, or federal board of elections (depending on
the office). The application window closes after seven days, at which time the
board publishes a list of applicants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nomination</strong>  At this time, any eligible voter can go to their local board
of elections office and sign a petition to nominate any number of applicants.
After four weeks, the petitions are closed, and the N candidates with the most
signatures for each office receive a nomination.  (N is set by law, and can be
different for each office; N &gt; 2.) The board of elections publishes the lists
of nominees at this time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Election</strong>:  After six weeks to campaign, a primary election is held.
The ballots are a ranked-choice voting system.  All but two candidates for each
office are eliminated using instant-runoff rules.  The polls should be open for
a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Election</strong>:  After a final four weeks of campaigning, a general
election is held between the two candidates for each office. No write-in or
none-of-the-above voting is allowed. The polls should be open for a week.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire process takes four months.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>time-traveling post-human nanotech robot</p>
<p>[WP] A post-human nanotech robot (PHNR) from the future time-travels to sometime in the first half of the twentieth century. They want to change the world for the better, but sets strict rules on themself to prevent themself from dominating humanity:</p>
<ol>
<li>no disclosing their own existence.</li>
<li>no disclosing information or technology from the future.</li>
<li>no direct involvement in wars or altercations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, PHNR uses tiny unnoticeable nanotechnology to spy on just about evey human on the planet. They feed some small amount of gathered information to appropriate groups.</p>
<p>For example, if PHNR observes a conspiracy to commit a murder, they may choose to send an anonymous letter to the local police so they can attempt to prevent the crime.  If PHNR observes a crime, it can send a tip to the cops describeing the event and where evidence may be found.</p>
<p>PHNR uses this power judiciously: they never snitch on victimless criminals, rarely on minor crimes, never when it would give away too much information about their abilities. PHNR never assists corrupt government officials. They also send tips to journalists occasionally, especially about corrupt politicians and officials.</p>
<p>PHNR interferes in wars to give intelligence to the side it favors, if it favors one side. Otherwise it feeds information to civilian populations to help them avoid bombing and troop movements.</p>

<p>All of the world's librarians should collaborate on a giant electronic archive of humanity's written work.</p>
<p>If our civilization collapses, this archive can provide a somewhat complete record of human knowledge and works for the future.</p>
<p>Copies of the archive would be stored by anyone who wishes to make a copy.</p>
<p>It would be updated continuously, with annual releases.</p>
<p>Books, magazines, newspapers, science journals, scripts, screenplays, laws, public records, written music, letters, pamphlets, transcripts, as well as text published electronicly would be included.</p>
<p>It would primarily consist of plain text documents, (with static images illustrations as needed). Original scans and layout would not be included due to storage limitations.</p>
<p>The archive would consist of public-domain works, as well as works with appropriate free licenses.</p>
<p>I expect that it will be very large, and I hope it inspires new technology for read-only storage.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I answer r/worldbuilding&#39;s question: &#34;What are some of your world&#39;s architectural marvels?&#34;</p>
<p>A city center built in an excavated cavern under the Appalachian mountains. Five miles wide, fifteen miles long, a quarter-mile tall. The roof of the cavern is supported by narrow towers made of super-strong composite material.</p>
<p>The floor of the cavern is covered with tall buildings and parkland, with a street layout reminiscent of Manhattan. The population of the city center is about 3 million.</p>
<p>The walls and ceiling of the cavern are covered with screens that show a perfect stereo image of the sky.</p>
<p>Surrounding this city center are smaller caverns containing suburbs, industry, and agriculture. All are connected by thousands of transportation tunnels that autonomous cars and trucks move through. The total population is around 20 million.</p>
<p>Over time, the city is working towards 100% sustainability, including fully recycling water and air. Power is piped in from a giant floating island in the Atlantic, covered in solar cells.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past months I&#39;ve moved this site twice.  Learn why.</p>
<p>When I started this site around ten years ago, I wanted something more reliable than a computer sitting in my bedroom, but still affordable. I ended up going with a service that provided a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).  I blogged with Movable Type until Wordpress came along.</p>
<p>Now, I've simply uploaded the site to cloud storage and wrote some scripts to generate the site and automate uploads.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the class I am sitting in on this semester - <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Admin/Courses/descriptions/257.html">Visual Solid Shape</a>, we use a piece of software called <a href="http://andrewthall.org/papers/draft7_7Feb05.pdf">shapemonger</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to get a better view at monge patch (a surface defined by (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>f</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)) so I wrote a little Python-VTK program to generate a vtkPolyData of the surface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">#!/usr/bin/vtkpython
import vtk

function = lambda x,y: x**2 - y**2
outputName = '/tmp/monge.vtp'

xmin, xmax = -1.0, 1.0
ymin, ymax = -1.0, 1.0

######
polyData = vtk.vtkPolyData()
points = vtk.vtkPoints()
index = 0
cells = vtk.vtkCellArray()
def makeQuad(cells,a,b,c,d):
    cells.InsertNextCell(4)
    cells.InsertCellPoint(a)
    cells.InsertCellPoint(b)
    cells.InsertCellPoint(c)
    cells.InsertCellPoint(d)
for i in xrange(resolution):
    x = xmin + (xmax-xmin) * i / float(resolution - 1)
    for j in xrange(resolution):
        y = ymin + (ymax - ymin) * j / float(resolution - 1)
        points.InsertPoint(index, x,y,function(x,y))
        if (i &gt; 0) and (j &gt; 0):
            makeQuad(
                cells,index,index-resolution,
                index-resolution-1,index-1)
        index += 1
polyData.SetPoints(points)
polyData.SetPolys(cells)
writer = vtk.vtkXMLPolyDataWriter()
writer.SetInput(polyData)
writer.SetFileName(outputName)
writer.Write()
print 'wrote to', outputName

<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/vtkviewer0.png" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>To make this surface look better, calculate the normals. The (unnormalized) normal direction is (-‚àÇf/‚àÇx,-‚àÇf/‚àÇy,1).</p>
<pre><code class="language-Python">.......

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you are writing a C++ program and are linking to a C library. Many of the library calls return a pointer to a heap-allocated structure. You are expected to free that structure using a specialized free function. For example, the openssl library has a BIGNUM type that is typically created using BN_new() and deleted using BN_free(); The following <code>Pointer&lt; BIGNUM, BN_clear_free &gt;</code> class will take ownership of the BIGNUM pointer in a smart-pointer way and call the BN_free() function when ever the BIGNUM_ptr goes out of scope.</p>
<p>This allows me to exit a function in any of several places (using return or throw) without explicitly freeing memeory.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Each member of a legislature has a set of public git repositories; each repository is a proposed law. A legislator can &quot;vote&quot; for any commit in one of his or someone else's repos by digitally signing the commit's hash. As soon as a particular version of a law (in the form of a particular commit) has 50%+1 of the legislator's signatures, it is passed.</p>
<p>Why do I want this? git blame.</p>

<p>I've been saying things like this for some time. My only caveat is that it is important to keep both the income tax and the earned income tax credit to keep the system progressive. If the consumption tax is high enough, we could limit the income/payroll tax to income above what the median earner makes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When writing shell scripts to be executed on Linux, Unix, or Mac OS, one can
target bash or tcsh. I always reccomend targeting the standard Bourne Shell,
since it is guaranteed to exist on POSIX-compatable systems. Unforntunately, a
lot of bash-specific documentation exists. So we can go to the source for shell
standard: the Single UNIX Specification, <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/sh.html">The Standard Command Language
Interpreter</a>
and <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html">The Shell Command
Language</a>.</p>

			<title>A new printer with Ubuntu 12.04</title>
			<link>https://halcanary.org/vv/2012/06/16/1285/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We have a WiFi network printer in the house: a Kodak ESP C315. The most recent version of Ubuntu (Ubuntu 12.04 Precise) does not recognize it and it asks for a PPD file. This is because the printer-driver-c2esp package is at version 23.1 but version 24 provides that file.</p>
<p>To install:</p>
<p>Get the necesary packages:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo /usr/bin/apt-get --yes install \
    build-essential cups libcups2-dev \
    libcupsimage2-dev libcupsdriver1-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Go to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cupsdriverkodak/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cupsdriverkodak/files/</a> and get the file <code>c2esp24.tar.gz</code> .</p>
<pre><code>$ cd `mktemp -d`
$ tar --extract --gzip --file ((...path to...))/c2esp24.tar.gz
$ cd c2esp24/
$ make
$ find . -iname \*.ppd
</code></pre>
<p>Copy the apropriate PPD file to /usr/local/share/ppd/</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ppd
$ sudo cp ppd/Kodak_ESP_C31x_Series.ppd /usr/local/share/ppd/
$ system-config-printer
</code></pre>
<p>Then enter <code>/usr/local/share/ppd/Kodak_ESP_C31x_Series.ppd</code> where the CUPS configuration program asks for a PPD file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
## ${HOME}/bin/wmctrl-snap-edge
#DTPD#
WMCTRL=&quot;${HOME}/bin/wmctrl_`arch`&quot;
#WMCTRL=&quot;/usr/bin/wmctrl&quot;
test -x &quot;/usr/bin/xdpyinfo&quot; -a -x &quot;$WMCTRL&quot; || {
    echo &quot;error&quot;; exit 1; }

HALF=$(($WIDTH / 2));
&quot;$WMCTRL&quot; -r :ACTIVE: -b add,maximized_vert;
if test &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;left&quot; ; then

	&quot;$WMCTRL&quot; -r :ACTIVE: -e 0,$HALF,0,$HALF,-1

</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have wmctrl installed, you can apt-get it (Ubuntu):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo apt-get --yes install wmctrl
</code></pre>
<p>Or compile it yourself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo yum install libXmu-devel
cd /tmp
wget 'http://tomas.styblo.name/wmctrl/dist/wmctrl-1.07.tar.gz'
tar --extract --gzip --file &quot;wmctrl-1.07.tar.gz&quot;
cd wmctrl-1.07
./configure
make -j 4
mv wmctrl ${HOME}/bin/wmctrl_`arch`
</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to set up hotkeys. If you use Metacity like I do, then:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">gconftool-2 --type string --set \
	/apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_6 \
	'&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;Page_Up'

			<description><![CDATA[<ol>
<li>
<p>More than anything, today's biggest economic problem is high unemployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than anything, the banking industry's risky investments during the bubble caused the crash and the current high levels of unemployment. If the government had not bailed them out, most major banks would have gone bankrupt. We don't oppose banks or bailouts, but banks should be held accountable: strong regulation to prevent these things in the future, taxes to pay for future bailouts, and smaller banks that aren't ‚Äútoo big to fail.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federal tax and labor policy over the past thirty years has favored the super-rich (top 0.1%) at the expense of the median household. Too much of our productivity gains over this time period has gone to make the super-rich richer, and not enough has gone to the average American. Compare to the previous thirty years, when all Americans benefited more evenly from productivity gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monetary policy is serving the super-rich (creditors) at the expense of the average American (debtors) If we were to raise the medium-term inflation targets from a current 1‚Äì2% to a modest 4‚Äì5%, we could relieve the debt burden of the average American, stimulate investment, and reduce unemployment. This is opposed by the super-rich and those who are confused about the utility of a strong currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Austerity (cutting government spending in the face of high unemployment) hurts more than it helps, especially when our long-term intrest rates are so low. The best way to balance the budget is to return to full employment and tax capital gains like any other income. And we don't need to balance the budget until we return to full employment.</p>
</li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I bought an inexpensive GPS Friday. It was $45 (plus $5 for a case) at CompUSA/TigerDirect yesterday. It is not the easiest thing to use, but if you make a point to bookmark all the places you are going before you leave the house, then navigating to them is fairly easy.</p>
<p>I'm tired of getting lost on the expressway.</p>
<hr />
<p>We went to the NC State Zoo Saturday. It gets extra points for lots of walking paths. No reason to crowd the animals into one small area for lazy human's benefit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Craigslist may have destroyed the market for used bicycle shops.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm getting my bicycle fixed up at the shop. Probably something I should have been keeping up on over the past decade. When I'm done it'll be like having a new bike.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em>&middot;<em>V</em> =

<p>These letters are drilled into my head, but I realised yesterday that

version of it is</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em>&middot;<em>V</em> =
<em>N</em>&middot;<em>kT</em></div>
<p>where <em>N</em> is now a dimensionless number and <em>k</em> is comes from the
definition of <em>T</em>.  Let <em>œÅ</em> be our number density and the relation
simplifies to</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em> =
<em>œÅ</em>&middot;<em>kT</em></div>
<p>Pressure is density times temperature.</p>

			<title>Summer Non-house.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I had an idea for a beach non-house several years back but I'm not sure I ever wrote it down. Reading about the Dymaxion House reminded me of it.</p>
<p>I enjoy tent living, but dislike leaky tents and damp tent-floors. The latter issue can be solved by placing a wall tent on top of a inexpensive wooden platform‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI lived like that for a summer while working at a summer camp. The camp had a small building with a real bathroom and laundry facilities.</p>
<p>So the idea I had was a large circular wooden platform on stilts with a solid waterproof roof and a prefab bathroom‚Ää+‚Ääkitchen‚Ää+‚Äälaundry in the center. Ideally, the platform and roof could be prefab and assembled in place.</p>
<p>The edge of the roof would have canvas walls which could be lowered in the event of heavy rain or a chilly night. Light rain without accompanying heavy winds could be ignored, since the roof would significantly overhang the platform.</p>
<p>Depending on local conditions, insect screens or nets may be installed around the edge of the platform. In that case, the platform will need to be well-sealed.</p>
<p>The bath is a single room with walls and door, but the kitchen is just a sink, stove, and fridge on one of the outside walls of the bathroom. It is expected that kitchen counters and cabinets would be provided by free-standing furnature.</p>
<p>Electric outlets are availible both in the kitchen center and under the roof, along with light fixtures and perhaps ceiling fans.</p>
<p>Since there is very little privacy, the idea is to place them in secluded spots in the woods. It's obviously not for everyone, but would be popular with the back-to-nature crowd.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I really think a computer should last more than 32 months. Sloop, the computer I built in June 2008, failed yesterday. Coincidentally, I ripped the old HDDs out of Dalek the day before to send it to be recycled. Now I have two old boxes to recycle.</p>
<p>I bought a cheap desktop at the store yesterday and didn't even try to look for a good deal online. I just wanted to have a functioning computer. The new case is 34% smaller by volume (I just measured). I would have gotten something even smaller, but I wanted a t least one PCI slot, one PCI Express slot, and room to mount my old HDD. I named it Occam.</p>
<p>Occam is a Dell. The CPU is a Intel Pentium Dual-Core E5800. One benchmark rates this as 34% faster than Sloop's Athlon 64 X2 6000+, which was an upgrade 18 months ago.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Attention Emacs users. It took me a while to realize that new-style fonts can be enabled by adding this to the ~/.emacs file.</p>
<pre><code>(set-face-attribute 'default
  nil :font &quot;Monospace-11&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>So here's how I set up the look of Emacs in my .emacs:</p>
<pre><code>(require 'color-theme)
(color-theme-dark-laptop)
(set-scroll-bar-mode 'right)
(tool-bar-mode nil)
(menu-bar-mode nil)
(set-face-attribute 'default
  nil :font &quot;Monospace-11&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And here's my emacs startup script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#DTPD#
# ${HOME}/bin/e
if test &quot;$DISPLAY&quot; ; then
  nohup /usr/bin/emacsclient \
    -a '' -n  &quot;$@&quot; \
    &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
else
  exec /usr/bin/emacs &quot;$@&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>This startes emacs in daemon mode if it's not already running (there's not a lot of harm in leaving a daemon going in the background all the time) and then the client tell the daemon to spawn a new window to open the files mentioned in the command-line arguments. The &quot;nohup&quot; part deparents the server so you don't get error messages hitting your console.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I noticed that someone had the bright idea to layer Adobe Flash objects *over* images using a <code>&lt;div style=&quot;background-image:url($IMAGE_URL)&quot;&gt;</code>. That way, when the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433/">Flashblock add-on</a> blocks a Flash object, you can give users an idea of what you are blocking. Here's <a href="https://halcanary.org/pub/flashexample.html">an example of the technique in use,</a> but it won't make any sense if you aren't using Flashblock.</p>

At first I had trouble suspending disbelief on the premise, but the book was so well written that the suspension happened anyway. How? The author stuck to the premise perfectly, creating a perfectly self-consistant world. I was somewhat upset that even though most of the mysteries of the book were resolved in the final act, the wierd history was never really explained.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/e9a67ac5359668de48212d58d795a39e2b17cd04.jpg" alt="[cover]" />When I was looking for downloadable audiobooks from the public library, I checked out the audio version of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> by F. Scott Fitzgerald (<a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0743273567/The+Great+Gatsby">0743273567</a>), and read by Alexander Scourby (<a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?1602834725/The+Great+Gatsby+Audio">1602834725</a>). I'm glad I finally got around to this one; I keep telling myself that I'll read all the classics of American literature, but I never did, until I got started on the idea of listening to audiobooks while bicycling.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>No comparison. APT (the Advanced Packaging Tool) beats Windows Update by a million to one. I had hoped that Windows Seven would improve things, but no such luck.</p>
<p>APT: You run this script, once, in the background and it does everything.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>
<p>Windows Update: You run this program‚Äî</p>
<pre><code>%windir%\system32\wuapp.exe
</code></pre>
<p>‚Äîthen click on some things, then it downloads and installs, then it asks you to reboot. Then while it shuts down it does things, then while it boots up it does things, then you have to repeat the same process THREE TIMES to get all the updates!</p>
<hr />
<p>Also, here's my full script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# ${HOME}/bin/agu -- &quot;Apt, Get Updates&quot;
# Written by Hal Canary

<pre><code>%% FILE: basic.tex

<p>The file graph.tex is generated using Gnuplot like this:</p>

set style line 1 linecolor rgb &quot;black&quot; linewidth 1

<p>Here's the execution:</p>
<pre><code>$ gnuplot graph.gnuplot

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, I finally broke down and bought an ebook reader ‚Äî B&amp;N's $150 WiFi <a href="http://bn.com/nook/">Nook</a> (ISBN 9781400532629). It's a beautiful little device.</p>
<p>I got the Jonathan Adler Punctuation Cover (978161560062) since it's both very sturdy and cheaper than most.</p>
<p>I've already side-loaded 90 free books onto the device. These books have come from several places. In no particular order:</p>
<div class="indent"><p>‚Ä¢ The Lee County Public Library lets you borrow ebooks via Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software. You can use ADE to side-load ebooks onto a nook.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> ‚Äî the first place to go for books from the public domain. All of their books are now availible in ePub versions.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, Some of the scans availible are in the public domain, and are therefore downloadable. Generally, the Gutenberug editions are a higher quality than the Google versions, since The Gutenberg tries to be an ideal textual copy of the book while Google tries to be a good representation a particular physical book.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Many of the works of Cory Doctorow are availible as ePubs on his website, <a href="http://craphound.com/">Craphound</a>. I especially recommend <em>Makers</em> and <em>Little Brother</em>.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/titles.htm">The Baen Free Library</a> ‚Äî All copyrighted works which you may read for free, and all are availible as ePubs.</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/">The Baen CD Mirror</a> ‚Äî These files are also copyrighted but free to redistribute. The newer CDs have ePub files on them. The older CDs do not, but you can use a program like <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to covert file formats.</p></div>
<p>Places to buy eBooks:</p>
<div class="indent"><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://bn.com/ebooks">http://bn.com/ebooks</a> ‚Äî of course. Also check the <a href="http://bn.com/unbound">Unbound Blog</a> every friday for the name of a free book that can be added to your B&amp;N library that week. [Update. Here, too: <a href="http://bn.com/freelibrary">http://bn.com/freelibrary</a>]</p><p>‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.webscription.net/">Webscription</a> ‚Äî A store that sells unencombered ebooks, all of which are availible in ePub format.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Six days ago I woke up with a horrible back pain. I must have strained it at work, and I think those magazine recycling boxes are to blame. After taking it easy over the weekend I felt much better, but work exacerbates the pain.</p>
<p>After I let my boss know that my back was still hurting me, she pointed out that we had some lumbar support belts hidden away in the office. So I started using one and found that it helped me put less strain on the injured part of my back. But I look like a dork.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Even though I've studied this algorithm a couple of times, I've never had to implement it before. So I assigned it to myself.</p>
<pre><code>/** should have a time-complecity of O(N√ólog(N))
    and a space-compelcity of O(N) **/
void mergesort(int N, int array[]) {
  int k; // k is the block size.
  int x; //x is which block we are at.
  int i,j; //indices in old[]
  int p; // index in new[]
  int ilimit,jlimit; //end of blocks.
  int *hold = malloc(sizeof(hold) * N);
  if (hold == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr,&quot;malloc failed\n&quot;);
    exit(2);
  }
  int *new = hold;
  int *old = array;
  int *tmp;
  for (k = 1; k &lt; N; k *= 2) {
    p = 0;
    for (x = 0; x &lt; N; x += (2*k)) {
      i = x;
      ilimit = i + k;
      j = ilimit;
      if (ilimit &gt;= N) {
	while (i &lt; N)
	  new[p++] = old[i++];
 	break; //out of for-loop
      }
      jlimit = j + k;
      if (jlimit &gt;= N)
	jlimit = N;
      while (1) {
	if (old[i] &lt; old[j]) {
	  new[p++] = old[i++];
	  if (i == ilimit) {
	    while (j &lt; jlimit)
	      new[p++] = old[j++];
	    break; //out of while-loop
	  }
	} else {
	  new[p++] = old[j++];
	  if (j == jlimit) {
	    while (i &lt; ilimit)
	      new[p++] = old[i++];
	    break; //out of while-loop
	  }
	}
      } // End while loop.
    } // End inner for loop.
    tmp = old; old = new; new = tmp;
  }// End outer for loop.
  if (old != array)
    for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
      array[i] = old[i];
  free(hold);
  return;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next step is to translate to Java and use .compareTo() with arrays of references:</p>
<pre><code>  public static void mergeSort(Comparable array[]) {
    int N = array.length;
    int k; // k is the block size.
    int x; // x is which block we are at.
    int i,j; //indices in old[]
    int p; // index in new[]
    int ilimit,jlimit; // end of blocks.
    Comparable hold [] = new Comparable [N];
    Comparable neww [] = hold;
    Comparable old [] = array;
    Comparable tmp [];
    for (k = 1; k &lt; N; k *= 2) {
      p = 0;
      for (x = 0; x &lt; N; x += (2*k)) {
        i = x;
        ilimit = i + k;
        j = ilimit;
        if (ilimit &gt;= N) {

			<description><![CDATA[<p>About ten years ago, I wrote a C++ program to print out all the prime numbers less than a given number using trial division. I recently went back and looked at the program and realized how little I knew at the time. Even though my first CS class covered object-oriented programming in C++, we never really talked the about simply using the <code>new</code> keyword on arrays to make use of dynamic arrays. The topic was covered in my second CS class, which I took three years later.</p>
<pre><code>int *array;
int array_size = 128;
array = new int[array_size];

/* do somthing to fill the array */

int *temparray = new int[(array_size * 2)];
for (int i = 0; i &lt; array_size; i++)
    temparray[i] = array[i];
array_size = array_size * 2;
delete [] array;
array = temparray;
</code></pre>
<p>In the last few years, I have realized that for the simplest progrmas, C is often more efficient and straightforward than C++. In C, the code looks exactly the same, except that <code>new</code> is replaced by <code>malloc()</code> and <code>delete</code> is replaced by <code>free()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>int *array;
int *temparray;
int array_size = 128;
int i;
array = malloc(array_size * sizeof(*array));

/* do somthing to fill the array */

temparray = malloc(array_size * 2 * sizeof(*temparray));
for (i = 0; i &lt; array_size; i++)
    temparray[i] = array[i];
array_size = (array_size * 2);
free(array);
array = temparray;</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This example of why the right algorithm matters comes directly from my textbook. Here's the C implementation:</p>
<p>Bad:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
long int fib(long int n) {
  if (n==0)
    return 1;
  if (n==1)
    return 1;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc &lt;= 1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;argument?\n\n&quot;);
    exit(1);
  }
  long int n = atol(argv[1]);
  printf(&quot;f(%li) = %li\n&quot;,n,fib(n));
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Good:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
long int fib(long int n) {
  long a=1, b=1, c;
  int i;
  for (i = 1;i &lt; n; i++){
    c = a + b; a = b; b = c;
  }
  return b;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  if (argc &lt;= 1) {
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;argument?\n\n&quot;);
    exit(1);
  }
  long int n = atol(argv[1]);
  printf(&quot;f(%li) = %li\n&quot;,n,fib(n));
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>$ time ./fib2 38 ; time ./fib1 38
f(38) = 63245986

real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.004s
f(38) = 63245986

real	0m1.492s
user	0m1.428s
sys	0m0.004s
</code></pre>
<p>And you can show how nicely the good algorithm scales up by pulling out a bigint library, like Java's BigInteger:</p>
<pre><code>public class fib3 {
  public static String fib(int n) {
    java.math.BigInteger a,b,c;
    int i;
    a = b = java.math.BigInteger.ONE;
    for (i = 1;i &lt; n; i++) {
      c = a.add(b); a = b; b = c;
    }
    return b.toString();
  }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (args.length &lt; 1) {
      System.err.println(&quot;argument?&quot;);
      System.exit(1);
    }
    int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    System.out.print(&quot;f(&quot; +
      Integer.toString(n) + &quot;) = &quot;);
    System.out.println(fib(n));
  }
}</code></pre>

<li>Rinse the lentils after they are done cooking.</li>
<li>Add the beans and lentils.</li>
<li>Mix it all together; add more spices; add some water; let it cook together.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Updates to my diet: I've gone 90% vegan. That means that I have two or three meals a week that include meat and cheese. I also put milk in my coffee, but I only drink coffee a couple of times a week.</p>
<p>To make up for the protein, I'm eating a lot more beans and lentils. Lentils (like oatmeal porridge) can be cooked ahead of time. I'm experimenting with cooking them with veggies and spices. I'm also adding more variety of fresh veggies to the diet, including a lot of raw broccoli.</p>
<p>I've also gotten lazy about baking bread, so I'm buying whole-wheat bagels from the grocery and freezing them. I'll pull one out each day to thaw by lunch time. I can mop up the dressing off my salad bowl with the bread to season the bread and make cleanup faster.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Every so often, I meet someone who claims to be a libertarian. When I was young and stupid, I held these same beliefs; so I have to suppress the urge to educate them. Instead, I'll rant on my blog.</p>
<p>The following is from the Libertarian Party's platform</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We support a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of our natural resources. Private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining natural resources. Pollution and misuse of resources cause damage to our ecosystem. Governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to our environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection. Protecting the environment requires a clear definition and enforcement of individual rights in resources like land, water, air, and wildlife. Free markets and property rights stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect our environment and ecosystems. We realize that our planet's climate is constantly changing, but environmental advocates and social pressure are the most effective means of changing public behavior.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.lp.org/platform">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's crazy. To begin with, it goes against every bit of real-world evidence on the subject. Here's why. If you own a business, it makes sense to organize it as a limited liability company; this shields your family's assets from the liabilities of the business. You can also grow the business faster by selling shares. Suddenly, you have a corporation and officers of the corporation have a single duty: to make as much money as possible for the shareholders by any legal means. In the absence of environmental laws and regulations, that will often mean lots of pollution. To protect itself from lawsuits, the corporation can create a second corporation to do the actual polluting. That second corporation will have very few assets. If it gets sued by those hurt by the pollution, it can go bankrupt, leaving the shareholders of the first corporation reaping the profits, shielded by limited liability.</p>
<p>Strong property rights are no substitute for regulations, unless you want to eliminate the corporation.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's so hard to argue against people who lie about what they believe. Remember that GWB increased the size of government more than any other president. &gt; You are not against ‚Äúbig government‚Äù; you are in favor of ‚Äúlet's trim 10-20% off the government while leaving it pretty big‚Äù or something like that. &gt; &gt; If you really mean ‚Äúlet's trim 10-20%‚Äù can we please stop being so melodramatic?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It turns out I don't actually have class today. The classes are Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday ‚Äî but the Monday and Wednesday classes are every week, while the Thursday class is only the last week of the semester, to make up for the fact that the semester begins on a Thursday.</p>
<p>I did pick up my textbooks today. They are just as heavy and expensive as they always have been.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>What am I doing? I am considering where to apply for a master's program in computer science. In the mean time, I am taking the undergraduate classes at the local university that I would need anyway once I go to grad school. I'm still working full time at the bookstore.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I'm taking two classes: Algorithms and Digital Systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital Systems ‚Äî Covers data paths, controllers, memory systems, and register transfer level design, as well as finite state machine design, classical logic design, and storage element design. Hardware and software tools for digital system analysis and synthesis are explored. Textbook: Roth &amp; Kinney, <em>Fundamentals of Logic Design</em> (0495471690).</p>
<p>Algorithms ‚Äî The design, implementation, analysis, and application of a range of computer algorithms are explored. Function order of growth and amortized analysis are used in analyzing algorithms. A review and extension of data structure topics including stacks, queues, trees, graphs, lists, sets, hash tables, and heaps are covered. Algorithm design strategies such as divide-and- conquer, the greedy method, and dynamic programming are studied. Textbook: Kleinberg &amp; Tardos, <em>Algorithm Design</em> (0321295358).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Not a bad plan, considering that I made the decision to do this three weeks ago.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is Christmas Day, a US federal holiday that coincides with the Christian holiday Christmas. Christ is a transliteration of the Greek word ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ, which means ‚Äúsmeared with oil.‚Äù In the ancient Mediterranean, people smeared themselves with vegetable oil in much the same way that we use petroleum-based hair conditioners and skin lotion. But the Hebrew and Jewish peoples had a tradition of ritual smearing for kings; in this sense, the first Christians called Jesus the Christ to proclaim him rightful King of the Jews. Later Christians redefined the term to mean something else, since kings don't usually end up crucified before they take office.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If cocoa has health benefits, how do I maximize those benefits? Obviously hot chocolate mixes full of added sugar are bad. Is there a brand I should buy that maximizes flavonoid content?</p>
<p>UPDATE: I'm drinking (what I think is) unprocessed cocoa now, sweetened with sucralose, and dissolved in hot water with a little skim milk. It's a bitter taste, different from chocolate, but I can get used to it, just like getting used to drinking black coffee or unsweetened tea.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've spent a lot of time writing email the past few weeks, so this is on my mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep your work email separate from personal. People change jobs, your
friends shouldn't lose track of you because of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use the email account that comes with your ISP subscription. The next
time you move or change ISP you will be forced to get a new email account.
Combined with (1), this leaves two options: pay for a hosted email solution,
maybe with a personal domain-name, or use one of the free email providers. I
suggest Google's gmail.com, which offers IMAP connection so that you can check
you mail using your favorite email client (Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple's
Mail.app, Novell Evolution, Microsoft Outlook, Novell GroupWise, et cetera) as
well as on the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your email client to send plain-text email by default. This
usually produces much smaller message sizes and can easily be read by the most
email clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When replying to a email, delete most of the quoted message, leaving only
enough to give your reply context. At the very least, delete the signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are not replying to something in a previous message, don't hit
reply; instead, compose a new message. This makes a new thread in clients that
organize mails into threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't top post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are going to compose your message in a word processor before sending
it, copy-and-paste it into the email's body instead of sending an attachment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you must send an attachment, use an open file format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one I am very guilty of. If you don't have time to compose a proper
reply to an email that requires a reply, you should shoot off a quick
acknowledgement message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are at all technically savvy, go ahead and install GnuPG (if your
system didn't already have it) and configure your email client to make use of
it to sign your emails.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot-gtk
</code></pre>
<p>and then I wrote a little script to launch emacs with my favorite font:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
exec emacs-snapshot \
  -fn &quot;Monospace-11&quot; &quot;$@&quot;

<p>What to do with this info? first of all, print out the fingerprints and put them in your wallet.</p>
<p>Here's another thing I do:</p>
<pre><code>ssh-show-key-fingerprint | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/issue.ssh &gt; /dev/null
echo 'Banner /etc/issue.ssh' | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>This, of course, is in no way a secure way to check your fingerprint, since it is just as vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. But it works as a backup plan.</p>
<p>And some legal theories say you should insert these additional lines into your /ets/issue.ssh file:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to access my desktop's music library from my living room and play it through the amplifier and speakers there. So I grabbed my netbook, and after fumbling around with NFS for too long, I just tried:</p>
<pre><code>yum install sshfs
</code></pre>
<p>(It's a OLPC XO-1, so it's Redhat-based.) And then wrote a little script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/mount-music
mkdir -p &quot;${HOME}/music&quot;
sshfs hal@sloop:/d/music &quot;${HOME}/music&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I installed mpg123-alsa (by the simple expedient of copying the executable) and wrote a little script to run it.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
test -f &quot;${HOME}/music/index.txt&quot; || \
    sshfs hal@sloop:/d/music &quot;${HOME}/music&quot;
cd &quot;${HOME}/music&quot;
exec mpg123-alsa --control --long-tag \
    --shuffle --list index.txt
</code></pre>
<p>And index.txt is a file created with the find command on the server:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# run this script to refresh the index file.
cd $HOME/music
find . -type f -a -name '*.mp3' &gt; index.txt</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We may be out of the recession (in that gross domestic product is no longer
shrinking), but with a growing population, people delaying retirement because
investments failed, and increases in productivity (GDP-per-worker) unemployment
rates will continue inching upward. The stimulus package was not big enough to
return us to full employment. So once the stimulus spends itself out next year,
we may be in worse shape.</p>
<p>What do we need to do?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fix the fundamental issues with our economy.</p>
<p>1.a) Encourage energy efficiency with a Pigovian tax on carbon emissions. This
will reduce energy imports, help our trade deficit, and bring jobs home.
Instituting a border carbon tax adjustment will help.</p>
<p>1.b) Keep health-care from rising more. Subsidize health-care for the lower-
middle class. Regulate health insurance to get rid of the preexisting condition
unfairness. Nationalize the insurance companies if they refuse to play nice.</p>
<p>1.c) Insure the insurers. Just like the FDIC insures banks and charges a
premium to pay for potential bailout costs, do the same for insurance
companies. Call it the Federal Insurance Insurance Corporation (FIIC). So even
in the worst disasters, where insurance companies can go bankrupt, there would
be an institution that can step in and make things right. The FIIC would refuse
to re- insure a company like AIG , keeping it from becoming too-big-to-fail.</p>
<p>1.d) Get serious about other reforms of the financial markets. Does the
financial system really deserve to make such huge profits? Do they add that
much value to the economy as a whole? You will know that a financial system is
properly regulated when investment bankers make the same salary as an
accountant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue with the monetary stimulus until we see real indications of
inflation. So far, there are no indications, so we are not printing cash fast
enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new fiscal stimulus bill big enough to close the unemployment gap within
12 months. If we paid people to dig ditches and fill them back in, that would
have the desired effect, but we can do better. Let us invest in more
energy-efficiency projects, like the cash-for-guzzlers program. Let us start
with a high-speed rail from Miami to Montr√©al. I know it is not shovel- ready,
but it could be if we threw enough dollars and workers at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have said it before: Short-term cyclic deficits are good, long-term
systemic deficits are bad. We need to get rid of the our systemic deficit. I do
not think we can reign in spending. Left-wing Democrats have got to realize
that we have to be the world's policeman and that is not going to be cheap. And
Republics should (but will not) admit that wars and defense spending must be
paid for with taxes on the rich. Running a federal deficit during the bubble
years was inexcusable. In fact, higher taxes would have kept the bubble in
check, to some extent. So we should immediately pass higher taxes on the
highest bracket, along with a provision that they will be automatically reduced
to current levels for as long as national unemployment is over 6%.</p>
</li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Back on the CD-ripping project. For popular music, the album titles and artists names are easy and the online databases almost always give me the right answer. But for classical music, there are always discrepancies. So I always change the <em>artist</em> field to be <em>Composer, Performers</em>.</p>
<p>After ripping a few CDs with Sound Juicer, I then run <a href="http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/">mp3gain</a> (<code>sudo apt-get install --yes mp3gain</code>) on the album.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/mp3gain-a-directory
## Written 2009 Hal Canary, #DTPD#
renice 10 $$ &gt; /dev/null
for dir in &quot;$@&quot; ; do
  if [ ! -d &quot;${dir}&quot; ] ; then
    echo &quot;'${dir}' is not a directory&quot; &gt;&amp;2
  else
    if ( /bin/ls &quot;${dir}/&quot;*.mp3 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ) ; then
      /usr/bin/mp3gain -k -a &quot;${dir}/&quot;*.mp3
    else
      echo &quot;'${dir}' has no .mp3 files in it.&quot; &gt;&amp;2
    fi
  fi
done
</code></pre>
<p>That little script takes a list of directories as arguments, treats all of the mp3 files in a directory as an album and applies the same gain (<code>-a</code>) to each mp3 file in the directory. The <code>-k</code> tells it ‚Äúof course I don't want to clip the sound; don't ask me every time.‚Äù Since this operation is processor- and I/O-intensive, the <code>renice</code> is always appreciated.</p>
<p>Or, if I want to all of the directories at once, I can run this command:</p>
<pre><code>find &quot;${HOME}/Music/CDs&quot; -type d -exec mp3gain-a-directory &quot;{}&quot; \;
</code></pre>
<p>mp3gain is nice in that it notices that it's already modified a mp3 and won't waste time on it again.</p>

			<pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2009 14:17:59 -0500</pubDate>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Since id3lib is incompatable with version 2.4 id3 tags produced by Sound Juicer, you need to use gstreamer and id3mux to grab the tag info to--for example--renormalize your filenames. Tags can themselves be edited in Rhythmbox.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#~/bin/id3v24-info.sh
#DTPD
for file in &quot;$@&quot; ; do
  TMP=`/bin/tempfile`
  echo &quot;$file&quot;
  gst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=/proc/self/fd/0 \
    ! id3demux ! fakesink -t \
    &lt; &quot;${file}&quot; &gt; &quot;$TMP&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null
  for tag in 'title' 'artist' 'album' 'genre' \
      'track count' 'track number' 'disc number' \
      'artist sortname' ; do
    grep &quot;${tag}:&quot; &quot;$TMP&quot; | \
      awk -F &quot;${tag}: &quot; &quot;{ print \&quot;  ${tag} = \&quot; \$2 }&quot;
  done
  rm &quot;$TMP&quot;
done
</code></pre>
<p>So my workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rip a stack of CDs in Sound Juicer.</li>
<li>Notice that the tags aren't right or don't fit with the other tags in the collection</li>
<li>Edit tags in rhythmbox</li>
<li>Run a script to renormalize the filename.</li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the energy-efficient future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Picture a Manhattan block in mid-December, crammed with high-rise apartment buildings full of lights, people, and warmth. Several thousand people live on the block. All of their electricity, the fuel for their daily lives, comes from a compact natural gas turbine running in an underground installation in the center of the blcok., The heat produced from the turbine is used to create hot water and warm the entire block. Each one of these people would have an energy footprint with an efficiency above 90%, compared with the current 33% Americans now live at.</p>
<p>From <em>$20 per Gallon: How the Inevitable Rising Cost of Gas Will Change Our Lives for the Better</em> by Christopher Steiner (<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com///e/9780446549547">9780446549547</a>)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Say I want to send someone a URL that shows the product page for a given item at Bestbuy.com. I enter the SKU (for example, 9222637) into the search field and I get the following URL:</p>

_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&amp;_dynSessConf=8937

<p>Which is too damned long! Why not just send me to a simpler URL:</p>
<pre><code>http://bestbuy.com/sku/9222637

<p>Some merchants are easer than others. I've learned that given an ISBN (for example, 9781439132739), BN.com's shortest URL is:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've gotten addicted to watching Netflix's streaming video on S.'s computer. It sounds like getting their service working on Linux is a total nonstarter. This makes me sad.</p>
<p>I've had a 100GB partition reserved for windows on this desktop since I built it last year, but I haven't used it yet. When I finally found my XP install disk, I thought I'd give it a shot, but I was disappointed to discover that the install program could not correctly read fdisk's partiton table on the SATA drive, and the install program would have write over random parts of other partitions.</p>
<p>So I decided to try a more modern Windows. I don't own a copy of Vista, and do not want to steal it, so I downloaded the release candidate for Windows Seven. Now I'm wrapping up a backup of the majority of my file-systems, in preparation to try it out.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>UPDATE: Well, I got it working. Everything works except the Samsung ML-1210 printer.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>UPDATE #2: Turnes out that the problem is that Windows XP, Service Pack Zero, does not recognize HDDs larger than 128 x 230 bytes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>R. was looking for an easy way to share files among the computers in his house, most of which ran some version of Linux. SSH offers one solution to this question. Pro: it is available on all the Linux computers, is integrated with Gnome, allows shell as well as file access, and is secure over a wireless network. Cons: Poor support in Windows.</p>
<p>To set up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the OpenSSH D√¶mon. In Ubuntu, for example, &quot;sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server&quot; will install it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the local address of each machine with:</p>
<p>/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet addr' | awk '{print $1 &quot; &quot; $2}'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give each machine a unique and memorable hostname. Hostnames can be changed permanently by changing the contents of the file /etc/hostname (on debian-style systems) and until the next boot with &quot;sudo hostname NEWNAME&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the file /etc/hosts on each computer to list all of the local IP addresses for each computer on the network. (Under Windows, it's &quot;%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts&quot; and under MacOSX it's &quot;/private/etc/hosts&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Gnome, open the file browser Nautilus (&quot;nautilus&quot; from the command line)‚Üímenu bar‚ÜíFile‚ÜíConnect to server. In the dialog, select &quot;Service type&quot; to be SSH, give the hostname, and username only if it's different on the two computers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, one can enter &quot;nautilus sftp://USERNAME@HOSTNAME/DIRECTORY&quot; on the command line.</p>
<p>In recent versions of Nautilus/Gnome, you can bookmark locations like this. Then they will be availible from the Gnome Menu‚ÜíPlaces‚ÜíBookmarks.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My desktop does a fsck too foten for my tastes. Let's find out why</p>
<pre><code>hal@sloop:~$ sudo dumpe2fs /dev/sda1 | grep 'heck\|nt count'
dumpe2fs 1.40.8 (13-Mar-2008)
Mount count: 9
Maximum mount count: 35
Last checked: Tue Mar 3 17:38:44 2009
Check interval: 15552000 (6 months)
Next check after: Sun Aug 30 18:38:44 2009
</code></pre>
<p>I want it to check every three months or 150 boots. That's easy to do.</p>
<pre><code>sudo tune2fs -i 3m /dev/sda1
sudo tune2fs -c 150 /dev/sda1
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE (2011-04-11):</strong> I later realized that the fscks were being triggered at mount time by /ets/fstab. ‚ÄúThe sixth field, (fs_passno), is used by the fsck(8) program to determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot time.‚Äù</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, Chapman asked me &quot;How many computers DO you have in your house?&quot; Good question. There is (1) Sloop, the new one that I built last fall (Athlon 64 3500+) inside the old chassis from Lensman, which is now a inoperable mobo+cpu waiting to be recycled. Then there is (2) Olpc, the new netbook, which I sadly don't use often enough because I rarely leave the house. (3) Dalek is the computer I built in 2001 that still serves as my backup desktop. (4) Mazer is a P3-800 laptop I keep around because Olpc doesn't have a VGA-out socket for presentations. I've loaned Mazer to the housmate until he de-viruses his own computer (windoze user, go figure---and Steve's a computer professional!). (5) Nimrod is an ancient Pentium laptop that I forgot I had until this year's housecleaning. It still works, and I intend to get rid of it at some point. Then there's my old laptop, Hiro2, which has been broken since before I fully paid for it; but we aren't counting nonfunctional computers.</p>
<p>So yes, I own 5 functional computers. This weekend I found out that Dalek, even though it has a motherboard and processor from 2001 and has a Radeon 9200 GPU from 2004 and is running Linux will run World of Warcraft. Not well, mind you, but usable. Now Shauna and I can play together in my house. We're such dorks.</p>
<p>I've got Dalek set up on my dining room table with a giant 9-year-old CRT monitor and an ethernet cable running across the floor into my room. It's okay because it's been so long since I've had more than two people eat at my dining room table anyway. The other possibility is to squeeze both computers onto my desk. But that would be crowded. We'd bump elbows.</p>

Call it 5 hours, 27 minutes, and almost 13 seconds. This morning I woke up at 6 AM, Eastern Daylight time, UTC-4; so I got up at 10 AM UTC. This means I got up this morning at 4:32:47 local mean solar time.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spent the past week or two cleaning my room. The most recent spirt of activity was caused by a search for a CD-ROM I last saw floating around six months ago. It may be lost forever, becasue I never found it. I ended up carting a large box off to goodwill and filling four big trash bags.</p>
<p>Then last night I went through the clothes hanging on my closet. I removed over half of them becasue they were too big; I folded them up and boxed them. Even though they represent almost eighty pounds lost in the past two-and-a-half years, it's still a lot of money spent on clothes wasted. I think from now on I'm going to try to make do with a lot less clothing and try to purge the closet more often.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Setting up icecast+liveice so I can stream music from my PC to the internet. A simple</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y liveice icecast-server
</code></pre>
<p>installs the software. Use</p>
<pre><code>makepasswd --crypt
</code></pre>
<p>to make a password and a hash of that password for the icecast server. Edit the /etc/icecast/icecast.conf to put the hashed password in there. Set port, hostname, and server_name. I used my dyndns hostname for my server name and used 8888 for my port. I was sure to open that port on my firewall and forward it on my nat/router. Restart the server with</p>
<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/icecast-server start
</code></pre>
<p>Check the logs with</p>
<pre><code>tail -f /var/log/icecast/icecast.log
</code></pre>
<p>That will let you know if you have password errors connecting to the icecast server.</p>
<p>Now edit the file $HOME/.liveice.cfg by starting with the example found on the internets. Some of the values I put in are:</p>
<pre><code>SERVER localhost
PORT 8888
X_AUDIOCAST_LOGIN
PASSWORD XXXXXXXXXXXX
MOUNTPOINT /x
NO_SOUNDCARD
MIXER

<p><strong>UPDATE 2009-01-04</strong>: Just as I suspected, that code is highly inefficient. Here's a different algorithm which is much faster for large N.</p>

They wanted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format">RTF</a> documents. One would think plain text would be just as good, but it's easy enough to write a program that converts a utf8-encoded plain text document to a simple <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/RTF-Writer/lib/RTF/Cookbook.pod">RTF</a> document. And the output is about a third of the size of the document that you would get from using oowriter.</p>

<p>For a manuscript, you don't want to do any fancy formating, bold text, fonts, colors, curly quotes, et cetera. This avoids all of that jazz. One might want italic text, but that's not <a href="http://everything2.com/title/fASCIIst">fASCIIst</a> enough, is it?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I went to early vote this morning. This is the first of two Saturdays that the polls are open. It seems to me that they should be open Sundays as well.</p>
<p>There are five early voting locations in this county, so I had to drive a bit to get there, but the convenience of being able to vote on a Saturday morning made it worth it.</p>
<p>I had to wait in line less than half an hour; I should have timed it. The line went out the door of the county supervisor of elections branch office and into the next door, some kind of abandoned store.</p>
<p>Since there were voters from all precincts there (all in different congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, county commission districts, fire control districts, and sub-municipalities), they printed out ballots as needed. To get our identity, they swiped the magnetic strip on our state ID (driver license).</p>
<p>After filling out the bubbles on the ballots, we fed them into a machine that read them. There was no feedback on whether the machine read the ballots correctly. I have to hope that somebody performs spot-checks to verify that the optical scan machines are functioning properly.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Just as <em>you suspected</em>, Barack Obama is <em>wrong for you</em>.&quot; --John McCain radio ad, heard in FLorida.</p>
<p>Think about this for a while. Why might someone be <strong>suspicious</strong> of Obama? Maybe they don't want to admit out lout that that are afraid of black men. And the &quot;for you&quot; bit: this ties into a segregationist viewpoint where it's okay if Obama wants to be president of black America, but not okay if he wants to be president of <strong>you</strong>, white America. In fact, it would be <strong>wrong</strong> for a black man to be president of <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>It's subtle, though.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2008-10-18_sailing.jpg" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>This was our sail yesterday. The big blue arrow shows the predominate wind. The tide was initially against up as we went downriver. After motoring out of Port Sanibel behind Punta Rassa, we raised our sails when we hit the main Caloosahatchee channel. We sailed almost due south on a beam reach, using the motor for a while against the tide, until we got past the bridge. We use the motor most of the time we go under the bridge, because the wind is unpredictable there and the big boats have a habit of tossing us about.</p>
<p>We made good time all the way down to the Point Ybel Lighthouse on the tip of Sanibel Island. At that point we gybed around to a broad reach and headed for Estero Island. We gybed twice again, beating downwind. This annoyed the hell out of me, so I convinced the skipper to let me rig the jib wing-on-wing using an improvised spinnaker pole made out of the boathook. This let us sail east, directly toward our destination, at about the same speed. This is a lot easier to rig than the spinnaker.</p>
<p>After a while, we decided to head back, beating upwind and making good time, once we realized that the fairleads needed adjusting (again).</p>
<p>about 13 miles total.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>More universe building:</p>
<p>(4) The Historocrats. Your basic time travel story. Five hundred years in the future, a group of people decide that human civilization messed up too badly and goes back in time to start over. They are accompanied by a group of historians who just want to find out how people lived before the invention of writing. So a large group travels back to 4001 BCE (6000 HE) and set up small nation on an island somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I see that my computer seems to display U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK ‚Äô) with a glyph identical to U+02bc (MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE  º). WordPress and most other software seem to convert U+0027 (APOSTROPHE ') to U+2019. That's odd, because nine out of ten times, it's an apostrophe, not a single quote.</p>
<p>Of course the crotchety of fASCIIst in me says stick to the 0x27. Straight apostrophes were good enough for every great novel ever make on a typewriter.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>(I'm reading a book on recent economics. It's in the current affairs section of the store and is written by the son of a famous economist.)</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom is that: &quot;We can <em>get away with</em> running trade deficits because foreigners are <em>willing</em> to hold onto dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>But the reality is (maybe): &quot;Foreigners <em>insist</em> on holding onto dollars (and US investments), <em>causing</em> a trade deficit.&quot;</p>
<p>They have some dollars in their hand and what do they do with them? Do they buy American goods and services? Nope. They invest them in the US government (T-bills) and in US business (stocks and bonds). This causes a trade deficit, and that's not a bad thing. What are we going to do, force them to buy American? It's not that American goods are shoddy or something, it's that the US dollar and US investments are <strong>so</strong> shiny. If the dollar wasn't shiny and if American goods and services weren't any good, then foreigners would buy commodities from us at market value and make the deficit go away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, [US Trade Deficit] = [US government budget deficit] + [US business deficit] + [US household deficit]. When the budget was balanced in the late 90s, it forced the private sector to run big deficits and we saw negative household savings for the first time ever. (maybe?)</p>
<p>I'm not sure I can wrap my head around this yet.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_deficit_(economics)">missed a variable</a>. The correct equation is:</p>
<div class="centered">TradeDeficit = BudgetDeficit + Investment ‚Äì NetSavings</div>
<p>And since Net Savings is negative these days,</p>
<div class="centered">TradeDeficit = PublicBudgetDeficit + PrivateBudgetDeficit + Investment</div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As far as writing fiction goes, I'm doing as poorly as ever, but I've had some fun recently doing some universe building.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>(1) The Science Fantasy universe. This universe is exactly like our own, with two differences. First of all, the laws of geology make subterranean caverns a hundred times more numerous. Secondly, there are three extant species in genus Homo. The most numerous is Homo sapiens, normal, modern humans.</p>
<p>The second species is Homo aelfens, the elf. Elves have about twice the lifespan of humans, stand on average six inches shorter than humans, have pointy ears and delicate features. Elves come in all colors, from pale white to dark black, with less pink or yellow color than humans. Culturally, elves are as diverse as humans. Most elves tend to avoid living ion close contact with humans unless forced by circumstance.</p>
<p>The third species is Homo gobelinus, the goblin. Goblins tend to be shorter than elves, and more heavily built than humans. Goblins have round faces, pointy ears, and a greenish tint to their skin. Their culture tends to evil. Goblins consider humans and elves to be inherent enemies of their species.</p>
<p>Both goblins and elves have been slowly pushed out of the way as human technology has advanced over the last few millennia. Since the neolithic agricultural revolution over ten thousand years ago, the human population has been exponentially growing, but the population of goblins and elves has grown much more slowly. There may be at most a few million of each.</p>
<p>Elves and Goblins tend to live in mountain caverns. For example, the large cavern system under the alps has been home to one of the greatest elven kingdoms in history, but is also home to a large nation of goblins. These two groups have been at war with each other for thousands of years, with much of the fighting taking place underground, outside of knowledge of humanity.</p>
<p>What do elves and goblins eat, if they aren't agrarian societies? They are very efficient hunter-gatherers. At some point, elves started specializing in particular non-agricultural trades. Elven crafted items, such as weapons or ornaments, are much prized by humans who often trade large volumes of grain and raw materials for these things. Goblins are less inclined to trade, tending more often to raids on human towns. When humans seek retribution on goblins, it can either end with the humans wiping out all of the goblins in the area (since humans almost always have a numerical advantage) or the goblins manage get away with almost no casualties (since they can hide in and easily defend their caverns).</p>
<p>This universe has no magic, but humans have traditionally assumed that elves and goblins possessed magic. For example, elves are on average several IQ points smarter than humans. Elves developed something like the scientific method much earlier than humans. Two areas where this had a big impact were metallurgy (after elves learned iron-working from humans) and medicine. Since elves don't particularly like humans, they never had any desire to dominate or enslave humans (good for us) but also never wanted to teach humans anything (bad for us). The so-called magical skills that elves had were things like teleportation (hiding and being quiet in the woods to avoid persecution by the more numerous humans), making magical (id est high-quality) swords, or magical healing (Elvish physicians learned to wash their hands before surgery about four thousand years ago. They invented antibiotics three thousand years ago.)</p>
<p>The setting is the early twenty-first century. The plots might involve a human's very rare visit to an elvish city and involvement with &quot;the underworld.&quot;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>(2) The Galactic-Civilization universe. Aliens have built civilization that spans the milky way over the past few billion years, but since it uses wormholes that must be moves at very slow speeds to get around, they only got around to visiting Earth in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>Between 13 and 14 billion years ago, the universe began to expand from a hot, dense place to a (on average) cold, empty place. We call this the Big Bang, and it's still going on, with the expansion of the universe continuing to accelerate.</p>
<p>The first stars to form (the so-called Population III stars) tended to be large‚Äîfor some reason I still don't understand‚Äîand consequently short-lived. They quickly went supernova and ejected heavy elements into space. The next stars to form had more heavy elements in them, and were often small, long-lived, and had planets.</p>
<p>All this happened in the first billion years of the universe.</p>
<p>Between 12 and 13 billion years ago, what we would call biological life evolved for the first time in the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Between 10 and 11 billion years ago, the first intelligent people showed up, on one of those planets that evolved life early on. These people called themselves &quot;People,&quot; but everyone since that time has called them the Precursors. They built a great civilization, and explored the galaxy, moving at speeds that rarely exceeded a few percent of the speed of light. They left behind their second greatest invention: the first galactic wormhole network.</p>
<p>The Precursor Wormhole is elliptical loop of cosmic string a dozen meters across that sustains multiply-connected space, without significantly distorting spacetime in its vicinity. It requires vast sums of energy to produce, but the machinery that protects and sustains the cosmic string doesn't require energy and has been known to last for up to 10 billion years.</p>
<p>Precursor wormholes implode when subjected to strong accelerations or tidal forces or when forced into a closed time-like curve.</p>
<p>The Precursors used their wormholes to return quickly to their home planet after thousand-year voyages through interstellar space. In the end, they did not colonize space, but instead all returned home and eventually disappeared from the universe. Over the years, other species have used and extended the wormhole network.</p>
<p>More recently, the Travelers have explored this region of the galaxy and discovered via long distance astronomy that Earth was possibly habitable, owing to the rare existence of free oxygen in the atmosphere, and sent a wormhole termini from the closest point in the network‚Äîover a hundred light-years away.</p>
<p>The Travelers are a long-lived species of skinny humanoid starfarers engaged in exploration and trade. They control this region of the wormhole network, keeping lines of communication open, protecting commerce, and collecting tolls. They purchase Precursor Wormholes from the group that controls the Precursor factories that make them and thus extend their reach.</p>
<p>The Travelers are not themselves great scientists, builders or conquerors, although there have been such in their history. Instead, they are patient and curious.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Travelers were happy to find Humans living on Earth when they got here, as much as they give the impression that they found humanity primitive and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p>The Travelers brought a large comet from the outer solar system to the inner solar system to use as a base of operations. By shading the side of the comet facing the sun, they keep it from boiling away. The shade is covered in photovoltaics to provide power to their small base. The wormhole termini is kept in a nearby orbit.</p>
<p>Traveler needleships are skinny enough to fit through the eye of a wormhole, and run on efficient energy accumulators that accelerate the reaction mass to around 30 million m/s. The comet base provides a place for needleships to refuel and recharge, before exploring the solar system.</p>
<p>They opened communications with the human race, but were not particularly interested in providing much technology to humanity, preferring to wait until humanity was rich enough‚Äîon a galactic scale‚Äîto pay for it. And the Travelers felt that it would be irresponsible to allow humans access to the galaxy through their wormhole, considering how violent and unpredictable humanity could be.</p>
<p>But even as they were explaining this to the representatives of the major nations, they implied that there might circumstances under which they would take humans to the stars.</p>
<p>A small group of humans convinced the Travelers to help them found a colony in another star system. The Travelers knew about a race called the Stone Builders who were making a oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere on a young lifeless planet. The Stone Builders leased the human colony a large island on their planet and helped them establish earth flora and fauna on that island. In 2012, over a thousand human colonists left earth in a skyhook carrier that the Travelers brought into the system for that purpose. The colonists were loaded onto a needleship and sent through several dozen wormholes. Most of the supplies the colonists needed were provided at their destination by the Stone Builders: prefab homes, prepared soil, et cetera.</p>
<p>Why did the Stone Builders and the Travelers spend so much money on humanity? First of all, it was structured as a loan to colony‚Äînot to Earth‚Äî who was not allowed to forget their debt to them, and secondly, humanity very well might mess Earth up badly‚Äîand no amount on intervention on the part of the Travelers would be likely to help them out.</p>
<p>In some ways this is similar to the universe in <em>The Algebraist</em>.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>(3) The Space-Opera universe. I created this because there are many stories that simply can't be told in universe #2. The universe also exists as an answer to the Star Trek universe, which is‚Äîin so many ways‚Äîpoorly thought out.</p>
<p>I wanted to get humans into deep space as quickly as possible, so I allowed the discovery of a damaged light-drive-powered alien probe take place early in the twenty-first century. This gave Earth the light drive: a method of traveling at exactly the speed of light to any point in space with zero proper time. The energy consumption of the light drive is proportional to the mass being moved. For example, to leave the solar system from earth orbit, the energy consumption of the engine would be larger than the difference in gravitational potential energy between those two points in space. This is similar to Ken McLeod's &quot;Engines of Light.&quot;</p>
<p>The light drive allows humans to explore and colonize other star systems during the late twenty-first century. These early colonies tended to become isolated from the Solar system because of distance.</p>
<p>In the early twenty-second century, the first human-built super-thruster rocket is built, again, copied from alien technology. The super-thruster uses high-energy-density accumulators to produces an exhaust velocity near 10 million m/s and eventually are designed to produce high thrust as well. These accumulators are extremely expensive, but manage to revolutionize the energy economy on Earth.</p>
<p>In the late twenty-second century, a new type of space drive, the hyper-drive is built. This uses a very different physical principle than the light-drive. Under the hyper-drive, a star-ship moves through hyperspace at a speed determined by the efficiency of the hyper-drive, without relativistic effects. The physical laws governing hyperspace require a single privileged reference frame which corresponds roughly to the reference frame of the cosmic microwave background. The earliest hyper-drive ships allowed a speed around 35c. Over time, this speed increased geometrically.</p>
<p>The hero of many of our stories is an astronaut-explorer from the twenty-first century whose travels enough by light-ship that he is still relatively young by the early twenty-third century, when he returns to Earth on his last light-drive trip. He then joins the crew of a hyper-ship whose mission is to reestablish contact with lost colonies and explore unexplored star systems.</p>
<p>One of the conceits of the universe is that national politics on Earth don't change much over two centuries. In the US, NASA still is in charge of space exploration, and the NASA Astronaut Corps is still around, but by 2050, it has a new rank structure.</p>
<p>The spaceships of the twenty-first and early twenty-second century tend to be modular, assembled in low earth orbit as needed. Humans normally travel in capsules similar in design to an Apollo or a Soyuz capsule. Fuel tanks, FTL units, rocket modules, and consumable stockpiles are usually launched to orbit in separate low-cost unmanned rocket flights. Once the super-thruster is developed, the launch vehicles become smaller, easier to fuel, and reusable, until pre-assembled spaceships become the norm with the first hyper-ships.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Caribbean Islanders are odd people. They always want to talk religion, even if you met thirty seconds ago.</p>
<p>Last friday: &quot;You look like a priest. Are you a Jew?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must be a Jew. Are you a Jew?&quot;</p>
<p>I started ignoring him at that point.</p>
<p>And a few months ago, an islander woman started asking me about my religion. When I wouldn't admit to one, she looked at me like I was the most evil person she had met.</p>

			<title>cooking measures</title>
			<link>https://halcanary.org/vv/2008/09/07/731/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I have no idea how I got to thinking about cooking measures, but it's a topic that always confused me. How many teaspoons in a fluid ounce?</p>
<p>You only need to remember half-a-dozen rules</p>
<ol>
<li>Three teaspoons in a tablespoon.</li>
<li>Two tablespoons in a fluid ounce.</li>
<li>Sixteen ounces is a pound.</li>
<li>A <strong>p</strong>int (of water) is a <strong>p</strong>ound.</li>
<li>A cup is half a pint.</li>
<li>Two pints is a quarter gallon is a quart.</li>
</ol>
<p>Numbers 3-6 I have down. I always forget 1 and 2.</p>
<p>And for metric conversions you need to know two definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 inch is defined to be 2.54 centimeters.</li>
<li>1 US gallon is defined to be 231 cubic inches</li>
</ol>
<p>US Customary system of measure.</p>
<pre><code>tsp.	Tbsp.	fl. oz.	cup	pint	quart	gallon	exactly
1	1/3	1/6	1/48	1/96	1/192	1/768	= 4.92892159375 mL
3	1	1/2	1/16	1/32	1/64	1/256	= 14.78676478125 mL
6	2	1	1/8	1/16	1/32	1/128	= 29.5735295625 mL
48	16	8	1	1/2	1/4	1/16	= 236.5882365 mL
96	32	16	2	1	1/2	1/8	= 473.176473 mL
192	64	32	4	2	1	1/4	= 946.352946 mL
768	256	128	16	8	4	1	= 3785.411784 mL
</code></pre>
<p>These are the definitions I grew up with. Since 1inch := 2.54cm (by definition), 1 cubic inch = 16.387064 mL. Since 1 US gallon := 231 inch^3 (by definition), 1 US gallon = 3785.411784 mL = 3.785411784 L, exactly.</p>
<p>The teaspoon is totally out of place here. Whose idea was it to introduce a THREE into this system? Why not use fluid drams, which are 1/8 fl.oz? Too late now, I guess.</p>
<p>Here are three different attempts to shoehorn the customary units of cup, tablespoon, and teaspoon into the metric system. None of them works well, since you end up with too many improper fractions like 50/3, 25/2, or 25/6.</p>
<p>Metric System (Canada, New Zealand -&gt; 1Tbsp=15mL, 1cup=250mL)</p>
<pre><code>mL	tsp.	Tbsp.	cup	Liter
1	1/5	1/15	1/250	1/1000
5	1	1/3	1/50	1/200
15	3	1	3/50	3/200
250	50	50/3	1	1/4
1000	200	200/3	4	1
</code></pre>
<p>Metric System (Austrailia -&gt; 1Tbsp=20mL, 1cup=250mL)</p>
<pre><code>mL	tsp.	Tbsp.	cup	Liter
1	1/5	1/20	1/250	1/1000
5	1	1/4	1/50	1/200
20	4	1	2/25	1/50
250	50	12.5	1	1/4
1000	200	50	4	1
</code></pre>
<p>Metric System (US FDA -&gt; 1Tbsp=15m, 1cup=240mL)</p>
<pre><code>mL	tsp.	Tbsp.	cup	Liter
1	1/5	1/15	1/240	1/1000
5	1	1/3	1/48	1/200
15	3	1	1/16	3/200
240	48	16	1	6/25
1000	200	200/3	25/6	1
</code></pre>
<p>Since SI simply doesn't define these units, why use them at all? Seems tto confusing in a global economy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Let me mention a few books I've read this year that I want to recommend whole-heartedly.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/29c1e29e741ba0362868acc17baf2447686162c0.jpg" alt="[cover]" /> Cory Doctorow's <em>Little Brother</em> (9780765319852) from April 2008. Yes, it's a YA title, but as far as I can tell that just means that protagonist is an adolescent, not that the story is dumbed down. Themes include hacking, cryptography, civil liberty, terrorism, data mining, linux, sex, and civil disobedience. Doctorow's best book so far.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/798b7e0355c04fcc5040fb92d1c09d933fb1a90b.jpg" alt="[cover]" /> Neal Stephenson's <em>Anathem</em> (9780061474095), to be released 2008-09-09. I can't stress the awesomeness of this book enough. Themes include Platonic forms, directed acyclic graphs, kung fu, G√∂del metrics, monasticism, space travel, long-term timekeeping, a cappella music, conscienceless, the chronology protection conjecture, and the true nature of quantum mechanics. Just reading that list might have given way half the story. The book is a masterpiece.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/c5b10f5618e3f74329986022a55d6b27ad46d73a.jpg" alt="[cover]" /> Charles Stross's <em>Saturn's Children</em> (9780441015948) from July. Not his best book, as far as plot go, but worth reading if you care about the extinction of humanity, robots, robot sex, and the slowness and uncomfortableness of space travel.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>People ask what I eat. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>The Diet:</strong></p>
<p><em>Breakfast</em><br />
‚Ä¢ 1 quart of iced tea, prepared the night before and allowed to cool to room temperature before adding ice. (I like to start the day hydrated.)<br />
‚Ä¢ 1 cup Uncle Sam Cereal, served with non-fat milk, berries (straw-, black-, rasp-, or blue-), and 1 packet of sucralose.</p>
<p><em>Lunch</em><br />
‚Ä¢ Salad, prepared before work: Spinach or lettuce, cubed smoked turkey lunch-meat, cheese (reduced-fat feta, cheddar, or blue), nuts (pecans, almond slices, sunflower kernels, or peanuts), sometimes berries, and home-made vinaigrette.<br />
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup unsalted peanuts, mixed with half a box of raisins. (I sometimes make this my mid-morning snack, if I have an opportunity.)<br />
‚Ä¢ Two reduced-fat low-moisture Mozzarella string cheese sticks.<br />
‚Ä¢ 1 quart of iced tea, left over from breakfast.</p>
<p><em>Mid-afternoon Snack</em><br />
‚Ä¢ 1/2 cup unsalted peanuts, mixed with the other half of the box of raisins.<br />
‚Ä¢ Water.</p>
<p><em>Dinner</em><br />
‚Ä¢ An identical salad, prepared with lunch that morning.<br />
‚Ä¢ Water<br />
‚Ä¢ 2 cups of low-cal yogurt (if I'm still hungry).</p>
<p>UPDATE 2010-02-13: <a href="https://halcanary.org/vv/2010/02/13/907/">Olive Oil Balsamic Vinaigrette</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Because the syntax of the <em>/etc/sudoers</em> file is obscure, I'm noting down here exactly what I've done to mine:</p>
<pre><code>root	ALL=(ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/wodim
%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get
%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff

<p>This allows a few commonly used commands to be executed without a password.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rules of the game:</p>
<p>You can change anything you want about the federal tax code, but your changes must be revenue-neutral. No starve-the-beast proposals.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>My suggestion.</p>
<p>--&gt; Let A be the annual income a full-time (40-hour/week) minimum-wage worker would make.</p>
<p>--&gt; Let B be the annual income of the median worker. (50% of Americans make less than him, 50% more.)</p>
<p>--&gt; Let C be the income of the 67-percentile worker. (66.7% of Americans make less than him, 33.3% more.)</p>
<p>Replace current federal taxes with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Increase the EITC (earned income tax credit) to a very large level. Make it 0 at zero income, maximum at A, and get down to 0 again at B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Income tax of 50% on all income greater than C, minus philanthropic donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A huge tax on carbon emissions. On the order of $10 per gallon of gasoline, with an carbon-equivalent tax on coal, diesel, natural gas, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general policy that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax">negative externalities are taxed equal to the indirect cost</a> to society. Carbon emissions are the biggest part of this at the moment, but I like the idea of pollution taxes greater than the cost of totally cleaning up the pollution. And a big tax on non-reusable goods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>UPDATE: Hey, there's a website for <a href="http://www.carbontax.org/">revenue-neutral carbon taxes</a>!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Saw today that <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> ‚ÄúRazor‚Äù was nominated for the 2008 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. I wouldn't call a 104 minute film &quot;short,&quot; even if the abridged version premired on TV before it was released on DVD. I also noticed that I still hadn't watched it, even though the Netflix DVD was sitting on my desk.</p>
<p>So I watched it. Four nested flashbacks. Yeah, I'd vote for it, were I a voter. Although I did like ‚ÄúBlink.‚Äù</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a proposal for new e-mail protocols to completely replace existing SMTP/MIME/IMAP/POP protocols. There would be a phase-in period, lasting about 5-10 years, during which two systems would exist in paralel and servers would fall back to old protocols where the new ones aren't availible yet.</p>
<p>The name of the new protocols would be Email2. It would contain the following protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email2 E-Mail Client Protocol
<ul>
<li>client-server connections</li>
<li>replaces SMTP, IMAP, POP</li>
<li>Specifies how the client sends and
recieves messages from the server.</li>
<li>Client configuration is simplified:
user ONLY specifies e-mail address
and password.  No seperate inbound
and outbound configurations.</li>
<li>Use of TLS strongly recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Email2 E-Mail Server Protocol
<ul>
<li>server-server connections</li>
<li>replaces SMTP</li>
<li>meant to discourage spam</li>
<li>Use of TLS strongly recommended.</li>
<li>servers must verfy dns records of
sending server before accepting e-mail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Email2 E-Mail File Format
<ul>
<li>replaces MIME</li>
<li>8-bit</li>
<li>unicode (UTF-8) for all text,
including headers</li>
<li>mesage is compressed with DEFLATE
algorithm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Email2 E-Mail Storage Protocol
<ul>
<li>replaces maildir, mbox, et cetera</li>
<li>Can be used by all major OSes</li>
<li>similar to maildir</li>
<li>allows user to switch clients seamlessly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Email2 E-Mail File Format</h2>
<p>First of all, we need to get rid of 7-bit and linelength limitations that are part of SMTP.</p>
<p>The message is composed of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head</li>
<li>Body</li>
<li>Attachments</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, we would have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic number representing this file format.</li>
<li>0x0a</li>
<li>UTF-8 data (the head) with each field
seperated by a single unix-style endline.</li>
<li>0x0a0a (two endlines to specify the end of the head)</li>
<li>a gziped file containing the body</li>
<li>the attachemnts, somehow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The head is similar to SMTP headers, but is encoded in UTF-8. There are more restrictions on what can be in the headers, for instance &quot;From:&quot; must be identical to the email sending the message, or it will not be accepted. Mailing lists have their own specific headers.</p>
<p>Since the body may be long and the server won't need to read it (except for spam filtering), it will be compressed.</p>
<p>The body should <strong>not</strong> be HTML, since that introduces several security &amp; spam risks. I suggest UTF-8 text with a minimal markup syntax to allow for &quot;slightly rich&quot; text. The text of the body may have long lines intended to be wrapped to whatever screen is availible. It is not assumed that this plain text is monospaced or wrapped at 70 characters.</p>
<p>All printable Unicode characters are acceptable in the body.</p>
<p>Because plain text is so unacceptable to most people, we allow text to be transformed to italics, bold, monospaced, subscript, superscript, strikethrough, and underline.</p>
<p>Whole paragraphs (seperated by newlines) can be modified with indention, center, and rightjustify.</p>
<p>The minimal markup syntax would use the &quot;\&quot; backslash character as an escape character. The following codes would be used for text modifications:</p>
<pre><code>\{ec} = escape character, a literal &quot;\&quot;
\{bi} = begin italics
\{ei} = end italics
\{bb} = begin bold
\{eb} = end bold
\{bm} = begin monospaced
\{em} = end monospaced
\{bp} = begin subscriPt
\{ep} = end subscriPt
\{bt} = begin superscripT
\{et} = end superscripT
\{bs} = begin strikethrough
\{es} = end strikethrough
\{bu} = begin underline
\{eu} = end underline
\{bi} = begin indentation (this one *stacks*)
\{ei} = end indentation (only end one level)
\{cj} = begin center justification on this line
\{lj} = go back to left justification on this line
\{rj} = begin right justification on this line
</code></pre>
<p>The backslash character <strong>must</strong> be followed by one of those two-character escape codes to be a conforming document.</p>
<p>All conforming email clients should display this markup to the user in a consistant way and not expose the underlying escape characters.</p>
<p>Maformed escape syntax should always throw up an error. No conforming client can ever produce malfomerd syntax, so this might be spam.</p>
<p>Quoting previous email would always use the indentation markup, like a HTML blockquote element.</p>
<p>Additionally, whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines would be rendered just like they would in a plain-text document. One newline standard (such as CRLF or LF) would be chosen and all conforming clients would use it.<br />
Tabs would be rendered in a consistant way---for example one could put a tab-stop every 8 ems. (1 em is the width of a single &quot;m&quot; glyph.) Or base the tabs off of the width of the client's monospaced font.</p>
<p>Note that the following things are <strong>banned</strong> from this markup language: specifying fonts, specifying font types (other than monospace), specifying font size, specifying font color, specifying background color, blinking text, scrolling text, tables, embedded scripts, embedded images, or embedded documents. If you want any of that, you must attach an attachment.</p>
<p>Additionally, all conforming mail clinets <strong>must</strong> recognize IANA-registered URI schemes and make them into clickable (or otherwise selectable) links. But those links will look like URIs, to keep the process <strong>transparent</strong> to the user. URI's can be imbedded in the text in the form &quot;[whitespace]URI[whitespace]&quot;, &quot;(URI)&quot;, &quot;[URI]&quot;, &quot;{URI}&quot;, or &quot;<code>&lt;</code>URI<code>&gt;</code>&quot;. This should be recognizable by the client since URIs generally do not contain whitespace characters or <code>&lt;&gt;[](){}</code>.</p>
<p>The header has none of this markup.</p>
<p>For the N attachemtns, the Internet media type, the preferred document name, whether it is compressed, a checksum or cryptographic hash, and file length is specified. For security purposes, the client mut not open these attachments automatically and should call a virus scanner before opening them. It is recommended that all email clients attempt to compress the attachements with DEFLATE before attaching them. If the compression results are good, then they will be attached like that. (For example, the ZIP file format can include files either compressed or uncompressed.) a checksum for each attachment would be included in the email file format. The exact format would be part of the standard, but I don't have an opinion on how it should work.</p>
<h2>Email2 E-Mail Storage Protocol</h2>
<p>The new standard would specify a standard way of storing email in a filesystem, similar to Maildir. This way, a user can <strong>always</strong> switch email clients seamlessly. Furthermore, a default place to store email would be used, specifed for each operating system. For example, under Windows it would be something like</p>
<pre><code>	%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\Application Data\\email\\
</code></pre>
<p>and *NIX would use</p>
<pre><code>	$HOME/.email/
</code></pre>
<h2>Email2 E-Mail Client Protocol &amp; Server Protocol</h2>
<p>Email2 is a Client-Server-Server-Client protocol. No more forwarding email through a chain of servers. No more faking addresses.</p>
<p>Suppose bannana@orange.com wants to email mango@plum.com.</p>
<p>Bannana's client must connect to mail.orange.com directly, using a TLS encrypted session and verfying his creditions with a password (or optionally some other identifer, like a PKE key).</p>
<p>The connection is <strong>not</strong> SMTP, since we are throwing that protocol out the window. we'll call it a &quot;client-server&quot; connection.</p>
<p>mail.orange.com verifies that the e-mail is well-formed and that the &quot;From&quot; address matches the address that Bannana used to log in with.</p>
<p>mail.orange.com then connects directly to mail.plum.com using a TLS-encrypted &quot;server-server&quot; connection and identifies itself as mail.orange.com. mail.plum.com <strong>MUST</strong> verify that mail.orange.com is who they say they are through checking (1) dns entries AND (2) TLS encryption keys. mail.orange.com has already verified mail.plum.com.</p>
<p>mail.orange.com then hands over the e-mail to mango@plum.com. Before terminating the session, mail.plum.com (1) checks to see that the e-mail is from an address at @orange.com (2) tells mail.orange.com whether there is a mango@ this address (3) checks to see if the message is well-formed. If not, then orange knows that the e-mail is undeliverable and will tell the sending client that. (There is an undeliverable folder on the server just for that purpose.)</p>
<p>Next, (this is an optional step that awesome mail servers will be able to do) mail.plum.com consults a series of rules that Mango specified earlier and sorts the mail into a subfolder of the Inbox folder. For example, if the subject contains a specific keyword, it might go in a subfolder for that keyword. The server might run Spamasasain on the message and sort it into a Inbox/Spam folder. Why does the server do this and not the client? Becasue whe user might use two clients on two different machines to connect to the server and doesn't wat to repeat a bunch of rules!</p>
<p>Ideally, the rule format will be specified in the protocol.</p>
<p>Later, mango@plum.com creates a client-server connection with mail.plum.com This is a TLS-encrypted, fully authenticated connection. The first thing mango's client does is check the Inbox folder and all it's subfolders for new messages. It retrieves a few headers for each message (From, Subject, Date, Number of attachments, message length).</p>
<p>The client could be configured several different ways. If it is POP-style, it will immediately download all the messages and delete them off the server. If it is configured IMAP-style, it will leave messages on the server unless they are specifially deleted by ther user. It could also be configured mirror-style where it leaves a copy on the server but also mirrors each email lcoally. IMAP-style should be the default.</p>
<p>The user will see a heirarchy of folders:</p>
<pre><code>plum.com/
	Inbox/
		Spam/
		Knitting_Circle/
	Old/
		Bannana/
		Apple/
		Nectarine/
	Sent/
	Undeliverable/
	Outbox/
	Drafts/
	Trash/
Local Folders/
	Drafts
	Outbox/
	Trash/
	Bannana/
	Apple/
	Nectarine/
</code></pre>
<p>The user could drag-and-drop the new email from Bannana from plum.com/Inbox/ to plum.com/Old/Bannana . This would be an atomic operation that the server could perform without copying the email, just moving some pointers around.</p>
<p>I am no human-interface guru, so this could probably use some refining.</p>
<p>The client also has a way of changing the delivery rules on the server in some standard way.</p>
<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>Client-Server-Server-Server-Client Proticol would exist for mailing lists.</p>
<p>Suppose that bannana@orange.com wants to send a email to the Fruits mailing list, which has an email address of fruits%pear.com. mango@plum.com is on that list.</p>
<p>First of all, notice that mailing list addresses have a different syntax, replaceing the &quot;@&quot; with a &quot;%&quot;. the &quot;%&quot; is supposed to too like mutliple &quot;@&quot;s. [Is that going to be a problem with URI syntax? maybe we should use fruits#pear.com.]</p>
<p>For the first server-server connection, mail.orange.com connects to mail.pear.com, using the same authentication system. mail.pear.com then checks to see if there is a fruits mailing list and (this is important) if bannana@orange.com is authorized to email that list. mail.pear.com might be configured to reject anyone that is not on the list, or to reject anyone who isn't a list owner, or to allow anyone to post to the list (which is a <strong>BAD</strong> idea).</p>
<p>mail.pear.com looks through the mailing list and sorts it by domain name, then connects sequentially all the domains to deliver the email. These connections are again authenticated both ways. When mango@plum.com gets the message it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>From: Bannana &lt;bannana@orange.com&gt;
To: Fruits &lt;fruits%pear.com&gt;
Delivered To: mango &lt;mango@plum.com&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;Delivered To&quot; header was inserted by mail.plum.com (mail software are allowed to insert but not delete headers, but in general do less of this than the current generation of clients)</p>
<p>(*) A note about BCC (blind carbon copy). Assume that Bannana BCCed Mango on an email to Apple. Then Mango would see a header that says that.</p>
<pre><code>From: Bannana &lt;bannana@orange.com&gt;
To: Apple &lt;apple@pear.com&gt;
BCC: mango &lt;mango@plum.com&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If one BCC's a mailing list then:</p>
<pre><code>From: Bannana &lt;bannana@orange.com&gt;
To: Apple &lt;apple@pear.com&gt;
BCC: Fruits &lt;fruits%pear.com&gt;
Delivered To: mango &lt;mango@plum.com&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>is what Mango would see. Everyone on that list knows what list was BCCed. Apple, however, is in the dark.</p>
<p>There is no way to see who is on a mailing list unless you are an owner of that list. Of course the owner might make that information availible some other way.</p>
<h2>Timestamps</h2>
<p>All timestamps in the email header should use ISO 8601 in the following way: 2007-12-21 17:47:01-05:00. Clients can convert to local timezone if they wish. Clients may diplay dates using local conventions as well.</p>
<p>There are multiple timestamps in the header</p>
<ul>
<li>Date = when the client started to transmit</li>
<li>DateS = when the Sending server recieved the message</li>
<li>DateL = when the listsrev recieved the messafe</li>
<li>DateR = when the recieving server recieved the message</li>
<li>DateC = when the recieving client first noticed it</li>
</ul>
<p>Client machines often have incorrect clocks. Servers are encouraged to use NTP to keep thier clocks up to date, so maybe a client could be configured to use DateS to timestamp the real message.</p>
<h2>Dead addresses</h2>
<p>Since mail can no longer be forwarded, what happens when you get a new email address?</p>
<p>All email servers should keep a list of no-longer active email addresses and give an apropriate error code for undeliverable mail.</p>
<p>Delivery status:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliverable</li>
<li>Undeliverable - no such address</li>
<li>Undeliverable - account closed</li>
</ul>
<p>When a mail account is closed, the user or administrator can add a 1kb plain text (UTF-8) message explaining why it is closed and maybe another address to try.</p>
<p>This message should get back to the sender somehow, but not in the form of another email.</p>
<h2>Problems with this approac</h2>
<p>A lot of coding. But most of it is really simple stuff.</p>
<p>Clients will need to be able to connect to both kinds of email servers for the interum.</p>
<p>Mail-sorting rules might be difficult to stadardize.</p>
<p>The standard needs to specify EVERYTHING, so that various implementations are fully compatable.</p>
<p>The NSA will find it much more difficlt to spy on your email. Servers could be designed with a wiretap mode where all emails to and from a particular address are automatically forwarded to the apropriate law enforcement.</p>
<p>It will be much simpler to fight spam: simply delete the offending dns entries.</p>
<p>This gives too much power to the DNS servers and the certificate authorities.</p>
<p>What about servers that aren't connected to the internet 99+% of the time (most are)?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A ftp client that uses rcp/scp syntax</p>
<p>My XO-1 has gotten me interested in hacking in python again, since that is the XO's primary programming environment.</p>
<p>I quickly hacked out an ftp script in python since the default install lacked an ftp client. &quot;My next project will be to finally write version 1.0 of my fcp (FTP copy) program --- a ftp client that uses rcp/scp syntax.</p>
<p>Here's the first script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.5
import ftplib
import os
import getpass
host=&quot;hostname&quot;
user=&quot;hal&quot;
pas=getpass.getpass(user+&quot;@&quot;+host+&quot;'s password: &quot;)
# local file with path
localfile=&quot;ftpcp&quot;
# directory  on sever
dir=&quot;/www/pub&quot;
# filrnaame on server
filename=&quot;ftpcp.txt&quot;
# login to FTP
f=ftplib.FTP(host)
f.login(user, pas)
f.set_pasv(True)
f.cwd(dir)
f.storbinary(&quot;STOR &quot; + filename, open(localfile, 'rb'))
f.quit()
</code></pre>
<p>Next I've got to write some very savy code that can parse complex command-line options.</p>
<p>Then I've got to learn how to do everything else in python.</p>
<hr />
<p>Update: a function!</p>
<pre><code>import ftplib
import os
import getpass
def ftpputfiles(host, direct, *files, **kwds):
    'user defaults to $USERNAME if blank'
    # does little error checking.  this is bad!
    user, password = ('', '')
    if kwds.has_key('user'):
        user = kwds['user']
    if user == '':
        user = os.environ['USERNAME']

    if kwds.has_key('password'):
        password = kwds['password']
    if password == '':
        querystring = '%s@%s\'s password: ' % (user,host)
        password = getpass.getpass(querystring)

    f = ftplib.FTP(host)
    f.login(user, password)
    f.set_pasv(True)
    f.cwd(direct)
    for localfile in files :
        filename = os.path.basename(localfile)
        fl = open(localfile, 'rb')
        f.storbinary('STOR %s' % filename, fl)
        fl.close()
    f.quit()</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My second-generation ipod died this year. It was five years old. I have now replaced it with a $40 1GB flash-based thing (an Insignia Kix from Best Buy). It has %10 of the memory, but is 10 times as easy to use. Just copy files onto it, no messing around with a separate program to create playlists and update databases.</p>
<p>Of course, next year they'll have a 4GB product for the same price.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Was reading Gwyneth Cravens' <em>Power to Save the World: The Truth about Nuclear Energy</em> (ISBN 9780307266569) and ran across a couple of interesting things.</p>
<p>Smokers are significantly more likely to absorb radon gas into their lungs than non-smokers. (Radon can be found in uranium mines, but can easily be flushed out with better ventilation.)</p>
<p>And I like this quote from Rip Anderson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A nuclear plant that emitted as much radiation as a coal-fired plant would be shut down.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still only 50 pages into the book. It's a lot of basic science that I learned in high school, combined with a lot of facts I didn't know, written by an author who started learning the subject from a state of total ignorance.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A galactic system of measures used be several species to communicate with each other in a SF universe in my head. This is an explicitly <em>designed</em> system of units. Base 16 is used because of the importance of binary. Aliens might find caesium-133 as easy to use as humans do. I don't use multiples of the plank length‚Äîwhich might seem like the natural thing to do‚Äîbecause measuring the constant of gravitation accurately is harder than measuring the elementary charge, speed of light in vacuum, Planck's constant, or Boltzmann's constant. But my unit of electrical charge is ‚àö(2)√ó16<sup>^15</sup> times the Planck charge.</p>
<hr />
<p>L = length unit = wavelength of radiation from the transition between hyperfine ground states of caesium-133 atoms at absolute zero, as that radiation passes through a perfect vacuum = 3.26122557 centimeters = 0.0326122557 meters. (The length unit is exactly 299792458/9192631770 meters.)</p>
<p>T = time unit = 16<sup>^8</sup> √ó (Length unit / speed of light in a vacuum) = 0.467218464 seconds. Or the duration of 16<sup>^8</sup> periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom at rest at a temperature of 0 K. (The time unit is exactly 4294967296/9192631770 seconds.)</p>
<p>M = unit of mass = 16<sup>^32</sup> √ó Planck's constant / (speed of light √ó length unit) = 0.0230618313 kg, which makes plank's constant 16<sup>^-24</sup>. [I'm not sure of a nice way to state this definition.] (This unit is only as good as our measurement of Planck's constant, currently with an uncertainty of around 5√ó10<sup>^-8</sup>. But we're still arguing about how to define the kilogram.) [In the galaxy, the simplest way to realize this definition is to ask the most scientifically advanced species you can find to make a measurement of Planck's constant with minimal uncertainty and manufacture a few 1-unit-of-mass artifacts.]</p>
<div class="box">
<p><strong>Update 2020-09-18</strong>: note that the kilogram was redefined in terms of  Planck's constant in 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 kg := (Planck's constant) / (6.62607015√ó10<sup>^-34</sup> m¬≤/s)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the following is exact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 M = (16<sup>^32</sup> √ó 6.62607015 √ó 10<sup>^-34</sup> √ó 9192631770 / (299792458 √ó 299792458)) kg</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>C = unit of current = 52.3615416 amperes. The Current Unit is a constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, and placed 1 Length Unit apart in a vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force per length equal to 1/(2œÄ) M√óL/T¬≤/L.</p>
<p>E = unit of energy = M√óL¬≤/T¬≤ = 0.000112360968 joules</p>
<p>P = unit of temPerature = 7.05881935 Kelvins, which makes Boltzmann's constant 16<sup>^-16</sup>. One defines temperature in terms of the ideal-gas-law behavior of an ideal gas: the temperature of an ideal gas is defined to equal (16<sup>^16</sup>)(pressure)(volume)/(number of particles).</p>
<hr />
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p><em>c</em> = speed of light = 16<sup>^8</sup> L/T (by definition)</p>
<p><em>h</em> = Planck's constant 16<sup>^-24</sup> = M√óL¬≤/T (by definition)</p>
<p><em>q<sub>e</sub></em> = elementary charge = 16<sup>^-16</sup> √ó ‚àö(2 √ó the fine-structure constant) C√óT (measured)</p>
<p><em>G</em> = Newtonian constant of gravitation = 9.6853√ó10<sup>^-9</sup> L¬≥/M/T¬≤ (measured)</p>
<p><em>Œµ‚ÇÄ</em> = electric constant = vacuum permittivity = 16<sup>^-16</sup> T‚Å¥√óC¬≤/L¬≥/M (by definition)</p>
<p><em>Œº‚ÇÄ</em> = magnetic constant = vacuum permeability = 1 M√óL/T¬≤/C¬≤ (by definition)</p>
<p><em>k<sub>B</sub></em> = Boltzmann's constant = 16<sup>^-16</sup> M√óL¬≤/T¬≤/P (by definition)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Well, if we were really starting from scratch, I would go with a base 16
numbering system (already in use by programmers everywhere).</p>
<p>One would have to throw out SI units, which would cease to make sense. It would
also give us an opportunity to throw out the base 360/60/60 system
(degrees/minutes/seconds) and 24/60/60 (hours/minutes/seconds) that the
Babylonians saddled us with.</p>
<h2>Numbers</h2>
<p>The proposal: The sixteen digits 0123456789abcdef. Integers would be written</p>
<pre><code>dd,dddd,dddd
</code></pre>
<p>with four digit groups (16 bits each). Mixed numbers would be witten</p>
<pre><code>dd,dddd,dddd.ddd
</code></pre>
<p>and a decimal separating fractions. Floating-point numbers (or numbers in
scientific notation) would always be written</p>
<pre><code>d.dddPdd
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>d.dddP-dd
</code></pre>
<p>where &quot;<em>x</em>‚Å†P‚Å†<em>y</em>&quot; means &quot;<em>x</em> √ó 16<sup><em>y</em></sup>&quot; (P for exPonent.)</p>
<h2>Time</h2>
<p>The new minute would be 1/256 th of an average day. (5.625 old-minutes) The new
second would be 1/ 65536 th of a day (1.318 old-seconds).</p>
<p>(Note that you could always specify meeting times with only new-minutes, since
one never wants to be more specific than 1 new-minute for such things.
Therefore, &quot;meet me at 1:15 p.m.&quot; becomes &quot;meet me at :8D&quot;.  Days and time can
be specified simpler:  &quot;2007-10-31 13:46:45&quot; becomes &quot;7D7-A-1F:930&quot; (Year
<em>7D7</em>, month <em>A</em>, day <em>1F</em>, minute <em>93</em>, second <em>0</em>.))</p>
<h2>Length</h2>
<p>The new standard length would be around 9.202 centimeters. that would make the
speed of light equal to an even 16^8 (new standard lengths/new seconds)</p>
<h2>Angles</h2>
<p>The new degree would simply be 1/256th of a circle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Translating to and from binary would of course be trivial.</p>
<p>One would have to come up with new prefixes which mean &quot;256 times&quot;, &quot;1/256
times&quot;, &quot;1/65536 times&quot;, and &quot;65536 times&quot;‚Äîlike &quot;kilo&quot; means &quot;1000 times&quot;.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A proposal for a better calendar. (If we didn't have the Gregorian calendar
already and wanted to start from scratch.)</p>
<pre><code>No      Name            Days
--      ----            ----
01      January         30
02      February        31
03      March           30
04      April           31
05      May             30
06      June            31
07      July            30
08      August          31
09      September       30
10      October         31
11      November        30
12      December        30 or 31
</code></pre>
<p>This would space out the months more equitably. Almost all two-month periods
would be exactly 61 days, the exception being December in non-leap years.</p>
<p>I would define January 1 to be the day after the Winter Solstice (at a fixed
zero meridian). So all dates would be around ten days off from the Gregorain
calendar.</p>
<p>As a result of this rule there would be around 8 leap days every 33 years,
similar to how the Iranian/Persian/JalƒÅlƒ´ Calendar works.</p>
<hr />
<p>Of course the final calendar we will all come to accept millennia from now will
probably simply be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time">TAI</a> with picosecond
precision, expressed as a number of seconds since some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29">fixed
instant</a>. Then
calculating intervals become trivially simple, and we will just ignore where
the sun is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Additional, optional rules to make this a perpetual calendar: January 1 is
always a Saturday. Then on 365-day years, you would get two Saturdays in a row:</p>
<pre><code>12-29 12-30 | 01-01 01-02 01-03
 Fri   Sat  |  Sat   Sun   Mon
</code></pre>
<p>Or a double weekend on leap years:</p>
<pre><code>12-29 12-30 12-31 | 01-01 01-02 01-03
 Fri   Sat   Sun  |  Sat   Sun   Mon
</code></pre>
<div class="box">
<p>Note that one could make the existing Gregorian Calendar into a perpetual
calendar by defining March 1 as always a Saturday.</p>
<pre><code>02-27 02-28 | 03-01 03-02 03-03
 Fri   Sat  |  Sat   Sun   Mon

02-27 02-28 02-29 | 03-01 03-02 03-03
 Fri   Sat   Sun  |  Sat   Sun   Mon
</code></pre>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE 2008-10-25:</strong> Here's very simple python code to give the month, day,
and week, given the day of year.</p>
<pre><code># returns (month, day-of-month, weekday)
# given day-of-year
def dayandmonth(yday):
    assert (yday &gt; 0) and (yday &lt; 367)
    da = ((yday - 1) % 61) + 1
    mo = (((yday - 1) // 61 ) * 2) + 1
    if (da &gt; 30):
        da = da - 30
        mo = mo + 1
    wd = (yday - 1) % 7 +1
    return (mo, da, wd)
</code></pre>
<p>And a leap year function:</p>
<pre><code># offset is determined by solar
# observations at the reference
# longitude
def isleapyear2(y, offset=6):
    n = (y + offset) % 33
    return n and not (n % 4)
</code></pre>
<p>Every 10,000 years, the offset may need to be changed. After 100,000 years, a
new algorithm will likely be necessary</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE 2020-04-22:</strong></p>
<p>Here's another common option for a perpetual calendar.  Insert one or two
non-weekdays into the year.  With this option, each quarter is always exactly
13 weeks, and starts on a Sunday.  Many businesses use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-4-5_calendar">4‚Äì4‚Äì5
calendar</a> because this property
is so convienent.</p>
<pre><code>No   Name         Days     Starts With  Quarter
--   ----         ----     -----------  -------
01   January      30       Sunday       Q‚Ö†
02   February     31       Tuesday
03   March        30       Friday

04   April        31       Sunday      	Q‚Ö°
05   May          30       Wednesday
06   June         31       Friday

     [June 31 is not a weekday]

07   July         30       Sunday       Q‚Ö¢
08   August       31       Tuesday
09   September    30       Friday

10   October      31       Sunday       Q‚Ö£
11   November     30       Wednesday
12   December     30 or 31 Friday

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was browsing through a best-selling book on veganism that doesn't use the word vegan at all (Skinny Bitch, isbn:0762424931) and it got me thinking that maybe I should at least try to give up milk for a week. So I bought soymilk and put it on my cereal for a while.</p>
<p>I still find the stuff bland and tasteless. A poor substitute.</p>
<p>And it's more expensive than milk. If the dairy industry had no subsidies, then I expect milk would cost more than soymilk. Then I would think about switching, just to save money.</p>
<p>Odd how government policy encourages bad diet choices.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I hate <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">unnecessarily long URLs</a>. One of the things I always try to figure out how to leave out is the file name extension. As Tim Berners-Lee says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;cgi&quot;, even &quot;.html&quot; is something which will change. You may not be using HTML for that page in 20 years time, but you might want today's links to it to still be valid. The canonical way of making links to the W3C site doesn't use the extension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are two ways of doing this with Apache.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Insert this line into your &quot;.htaccess&quot; file:</p>
<p>DefaultType text/html</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then when you create any new html pages, call them &quot;foobar&quot; instead of &quot;foobar.html&quot; and then your URL will be:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/directory/foobar
</code></pre>
<p>and not</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/directory/foobar.html
</code></pre>
<p>Which makes more sense. Now you can at some later point in time change the default to .shtml or .php</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Put this in your &quot;.htaccess&quot; file:</p>
<p>Options All MultiViews</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then put a file called &quot;foobar.html&quot; in the directory &quot;directory/&quot; and the URL:</p>
<pre><code>http://example.com/directory/foobar
</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Favorite Firefox Addons:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1677">Go Up</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lets you go &quot;up&quot; a level in the current website via the provided toolbar button, or by pressing Alt+Up arrow. The &quot;up&quot; is determined by trimming the last section of the URL, e.g. example.org/foo/somepage.html becomes example.org/foo/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't use this much, but it does come in handy every so often.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433">Flashblock</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flashblock is an extension for the Mozilla, Firefox, and Netscape browsers that takes a pessimistic approach to dealing with Macromedia Flash content on a webpage and blocks ALL Flash content from loading. It then leaves placeholders on the webpage that allow you to click to download and then view the Flash content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a lifesaver. Try moving your mouse cursor over a piece of flash, then hitting the page-down key. Nothing happens, unless the flash is blocked.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2648">MM3-ProxySwitch</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Firefox Browser (and other Mozilla programs) you can per default configure only the setting for one internet connection. With the MM3-ProxySwitch you can manage different configurations and simply switch over between these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use this one on my laptop for managing proxies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4650">FullerScreen</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This extension enhances the Full Screen mode into a really full screen mode, hiding the remaining toolbars and statusbar and making them visible again when the mouse pointer hits an edge of the screen.</p>
<p>It also offers a slideshow mode, enabling @projection CSS rules in a document when full screen mode is turned on. Navigation between slides in implemented in the extension and a slide manager showing thumbnails for the slides is available through shift-F11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm still trying this out, but it seems like a good idea.</p>

			<title>Tension of a Spinning Ring</title>
			<link>https://halcanary.org/vv/2007/06/23/694/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>fun with physics</p>
<p>What is the tension in a spinning ring, for example Bank's orbitals or a Niven Ring?</p>
<p>Let us break the ring into <em>N</em> sections. The angle (in radians) subtended by each section, dŒ∏, is 2œÄ / <em>N</em>. Suppose the radius of the ring is <em>R</em> and the mass-per-unit-length of the ring is Œª; then the mass of a section is Œª <em>R</em> dŒ∏ and the mass of the whole ring <em>M</em> = 2œÄ_R_Œª.</p>
<p>Ignoring gravity, there are two forces pulling on each small section: tension pulling to the left and tension pulling to the right. Because the ring is circularly symmetric, the magnitude of the two tensions are equal. The directions of the two forces are dŒ∏ from being opposite.</p>
<p>If at some moment in time, the left tension, <em><strong>Tl</strong></em>, is pointing in the -<em><strong>xÃÇ</strong></em> direction, then the right tension will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Tr</strong></em> = <em>T</em> sin(dŒ∏) <em><strong>≈∑</strong></em> + <em>T</em> cos(dŒ∏) <em><strong>xÃÇ</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>T</em> is the magnitude of either tension.</p>
<p>As <em>N</em> gets large: dŒ∏ gets small, cos(dŒ∏) ‚Üí 1, and sin(dŒ∏) ‚Üí dŒ∏.  So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Tl</strong></em> = -<em>T</em> <em><strong>xÃÇ</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tr</strong></em> = +<em>T</em> <em><strong>xÃÇ</strong></em> + <em>T</em> dŒ∏ <em><strong>≈∑</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the centripetal force on the small section is _T_dŒ∏. From Newton's second law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚àë<strong>F</strong> = <em>m</em> <strong><em>a</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Tl</strong></em> + <em><strong>Tr</strong></em> = <em>m</em> <strong><em>a</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>T</em> dŒ∏ <em><strong>≈∑</strong></em> = <em>m</em> <strong><em>a</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <em>a</em> = |<em><strong>a</strong></em>|, the centripetal acceleration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>T</em> dŒ∏ = (Œª <em>R</em> dŒ∏) <em>a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>T</em> = Œª <em>R</em> <em>a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Part B: Plug in some numbers.</p>
<p>Let <em>S</em> be the specific strength, which is the maximum tension divided by density: <em>T</em> / Œª.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>S</em> ‚â• <em>R</em> <em>a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>R</em> ‚â§ <em>S</em> / <em>a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let <em>P</em> be the period of revolution. Since centrepetal acceleration, <em>a</em> = v¬≤ / <em>R</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> = v¬≤ / <em>R</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> = (2œÄ <em>R</em> / <em>P</em>)¬≤ / R</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> = 4œÄ¬≤ <em>R</em> / _P_¬≤</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> _P_¬≤ = 4œÄ¬≤ <em>R</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>a</em> _P_¬≤ ‚â§ 4œÄ¬≤ (<em>S</em> / <em>a</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>_P_¬≤ ‚â§ 4œÄ¬≤ <em>S</em> / _a_¬≤</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>P</em> ‚â§ 2œÄ ‚àö(<em>S</em>) / <em>a</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Assume our desired centripetal acceleration is an Earthly 10 m/s¬≤.</em></p>
<p>If the ring is made of solid steel, <em>S</em> = 154000 N¬∑m/kg (specific strength). With <em>a</em> = 10 m/s¬≤, we find that the maximum radius for a ring of steel is 15 kilometers. Period of revolution = 243 seconds = 4 minutes. If you assume that half of the mass of your ring is structural material and the other half is nonstructural, then you get a diameter of 15 km. Multiply the period by 1/‚àö2.</p>
<table class="border">
<tr><th>Average <em>T</em> / Œª</th><th> Radius </th><th>  Period </th><th> Comments         </th></tr>
<tr><td>     8 745 m¬≤/s¬≤ </td><td>       893 m </td><td>   60 s  </td><td> Stanford Torus   </td></tr>
<tr><td>    40 000 m¬≤/s¬≤ </td><td>     4 000 m </td><td>  125 s  </td><td> O'Neill cylinder </td></tr>

<tr><td>24 000 000 m¬≤/s¬≤ </td><td> 2 400 000 m </td><td> 3078 s  </td><td> 50% carbon nanotubes </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Carbon nanotubes: maximum size of 4800 kilometers. Period of revolution = 4353 seconds = 1.2 hours</p>
<p>The period of revolution for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(The_Culture)">Culture Orbital</a> is a convenient 24 hours. The radius of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld">Niven Ring</a> is 1 AU. Neither of these is feasible with today's understanding of physics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_torus">Stanford Torus</a> with a radius of 893 meters and an orbital period of 60 seconds would need to have an average specific strength of 8745 N¬∑m/kg, so at least 6% of the mass would need to be steel structure. (You would probably want a 4x fudge factor. Say 25% structural steel. Then sections of the ring could be replaced if they show signs of wear.)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I got my Kill-A-Watt electricity usage monitor in the mail today. So far I have discovered:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When completely powered off, the computer power supply and the television consume 5 watts each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The computer speakers/subwoofer consumes around seven watts if the power is off and around seven watts if the power is on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 19 inch LCD monitor consumes very little power when off and around 26 watts when on. (Most of which is radiated as visible light.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CPU consumes around 99 watts when running smoothly and not spinning the drives much.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I bought a boxed set of Knuth's <em>Art of Computer Programming</em> last week. As you may or may not know, TAOCP demonstrates programs in assembly for a mythical computer known as the MIX 1009. MIX would not have been out of place in 1965, but is hopelessly outdated today. Nonetheless, I learned enough MIX to write the following program in the MIX Assembly Language.</p>
<pre><code>* factorial.mixal
*
* calculate n factorial in MIXAL
*
* loops on rI1 from n down to 0
*
* n! must fit into a 30-byte word, or it overflows
* n must fit into a 12-byte index register,
* n must be positive.
*
* if n! overflows, it will throw an error.
*
* Tested with GNU MDK 1.2.3.
*
* assemble with:
*	mixasm factorial.mixal
* execute with:
*	mixvm --run factorial.mix
*
* This program is dedicated to the public domain.
*      ---Hal Canary, https://halcanary.org/
*
n	EQU	11	* Argument
pp	EQU	1000	* pointer to a memory address.
*			* We make use of pp and pp+1
term    EQU     19	* terminal
        ORIG    3000
start	ENTA	1
	ENTX	0
	ENT1	n
loop	ST1	pp
	MUL	pp	* pp! == pp * (pp-1)!
	CMPA	0	* Check for overflow
	JNE	ovrflw
	SLAX	5	* Shift rX back to rA.
	DEC1	1	* k &lt;- k-1
	J1P	loop	* if (k &gt; 0) loop back
	CHAR	0	* rAX &lt;- sprintf(&quot;%i&quot;, rA)
	STX	pp+1
	STA	pp
	OUT	pp(term)	* output pp and pp+1
        HLT
ovrflw	OUT	error0(term)
	HLT
error0	ALF	OVERF
	ALF	LOW
        END     start
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I had to write to memory in order to multiply two numbers together! Crazy.</p>
<p>(Factorial calculations are a common assignment in computer science 101, as they are a simple exercise in a language's looping constructs.)</p>
<p>Here's the same program, reimplemented for the Emmix 2009:</p>
<pre><code>* factorial.mmo
*
* Calculate factorial(NUMBER) in MMIXAL.
* If it overflows, it exits with no output.
*
* Tested with Donald E. Knuth's MMIXware (v20060918).
*
* Assemble with:
*	mmixal factorial.mms
* Execute with:
*	mmix factorial.mmo
*
* This program is dedicated to the public domain.

<p>This processor required me to (gasp) rewrite 'printf(&quot;%u&quot;,n);', which was the hardest part of the program.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a post I wrote almost a month ago and never posted:</p>
<p>2007-03-11</p>
<p>I went to the Linux Users Group the other night. The local LUG tries to have a presentation at every month's meeting. This is ambitious goal, so I thought I'd help out. I went home and started putting together a presentation on F/OSS crytography tools.</p>
<p>Then I realized that if I was going to give a presentation in front of the Linux group, I ought to get Linux working on my laptop. This has been a problem since I got this used laptop two years ago, since the CDROM drive refuses to read any CDs I put in it. So I did more research this week and found out that I can <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=118182">bootstrap from inside windows a copy of linux to run a network installer</a>.</p>
<p>I chose to install Ubuntu Linux because it has a reputation for good support for wifi cards. Without WiFi, a notebook is mostly useless to me. I had never installed Ubuntu before. In a sense, I still havn't: I install XUbuntu instead. XUbuntu is a scaled down version of Ubuntu that is supposed to use less resources by replacing Gnome with Xfce.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | head -8
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 8
model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
stepping        : 10
cpu MHz         : 700.000
cache size      : 256 KB

$ cat /proc/meminfo  | head -1
MemTotal:       385828 kB
</code></pre>
<p>This thing has got a 700 MHz Pentium III (Coppermine mobile) processor, which makes the processor design almost seven years old.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(X)Ubuntu works pretty well. I'm in the proccess of learning all about apt-get; otherwise a lot of my RH/Fedora knowledge translates over to Ubuntu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xfce is still a little rough round the edges, but it does what I want it to. I miss Gnome's Rhythmbox and Gedit, but I should learn to make do with less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wireless drivers work perfectly, BUT the GUI frontend (network-admin) is useless. I ended up writing my own scripts. This one lists all the availible networks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/scanwifi
## 2007 Hal Canary
## Dedicated to the Public Domain
sudo echo 'Restarting and scanning Wifi...'
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; ifconfig eth1 down &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1 down
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; ifconfig eth1 up &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1 up
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwconfig eth1 essid any &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo iwconfig eth1 essid any
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwconfig eth1 &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwlist eth1 scanning &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo iwlist eth1 scanning
exit 0
</code></pre>
<p>This one connects to the selected network:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/connectwifi
## 2007 Hal Canary
## Dedicated to the Public Domain
if [ &quot;$#&quot; -lt 1 ] ; then
    echo &quot;useage:&quot;
    echo &quot;  $0 SSID&quot;
    echo &quot;or:&quot;
    echo &quot;  $0 SSID KEY&quot;
    exit 1
fi
echo '########## iwconfig eth1 essid &quot;'$1'&quot; ########'
sudo iwconfig eth1 essid &quot;$1&quot;
if [ ! -z &quot;$2&quot; ] ; then
    echo '########## iwconfig eth1 key &quot;'$2'&quot; ########'
    sudo iwconfig eth1 key &quot;$2&quot;
fi
echo '########## dhclient eth1 ########'
sudo dhclient eth1
exit 0;
</code></pre>
<p>And this one connects to my home network (not my real key):</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/connectwifi.MySsid
connectwifi MySsid 0c0dc52de9fbc078f3c1411100
</code></pre>
<p>Disconnecting can be accomplished with a</p>
<pre><code>sudo ifconfig eth1 down
</code></pre>
<p>or by simply removing the network card.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In theory this laptop's battery has only about an hour's charge on it, but I think that if I keep disc and CPU useage down to a minimum, it can last longer. I've been sitting here outside for almost an hour and it's at 46%. This is to be expected with a LiIon battery this old. If I get a new battery for this thing, it would cost around $100. We got this whole laptop for less than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's geeting cold out, so I'm going to go home now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubuntu disallows the use of the login name 'hal', reserving it for the hardware abstraction layer daemon. This makes me sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ubuntu has a much more lax default security policy. Iptables is off my default. There is no SELinux.</p>
</li>

<p>Jesus knew viral marketing.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Mark, the disciple John complains that nondisciples are selling bootlegged copies of Jesus‚Äô miraculous powers. ‚ÄúTeacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Jesus tells John to quit obsessing about the intellectual property and to focus on getting the brand out. ‚ÄúDo not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.‚Äù Jesus adds, ‚ÄúWhoever is not against us is for us.‚Äù</p>

<p>Exactly how much entropy do we get?</p>
<p>Each character can be a z or a Z with a probability of 2/64 for each. The other 60 characters have a probability of 1/64 each. Apply the formula:</p>
<pre><code>information entropy
    = ‚àë(i=1, n, p(x[i]) log2(1 / p(x[i])))
    = ‚àë(i=1, 2, 2/64 *  log2(64/2)) + ‚àë(i=1, 60, 1/64 * log2(64/1))
    = 2 * (2/64) * log2(64/2) + 60 * (1/64) * log2(64/1)
    = 2 * (2/64) * 5 + 60 * 1/64 * 6
    = 20/64 + 360/64
    = 380/64
    = 5.9375
</code></pre>
<p>Mulitply by 24 for 24 characters, and get 142.5 bits of entropy.</p>

			<title>Shavegeek.</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Shavegeek</em> is an actual term, not invented by me. It refers to those guys who look down on Gillette Mach3 and Schick Quattro users like Unix hackers look down on Microsoft Windows users.</p>
<p>The shavegeeks recommend (please note that shavegeeks, like all geeks, will argue the pros and cons of any aspect of shaving: they don't speak with 100% unanimity.) using a bristle brush and shaving soap or cream and either a straight razor or double-edge safety razor.</p>
<p>My shaving routine for the past few years---since I grew out the beard on my cheeks as well as chin---has been to shave my neck every morning in the shower with ivory soap and a cartridge razor. My main gripe was the expense of the cartridge---each one cost more than a dollar, and are getting more expensive with each new upgrade. So I bought a <a href="http://www.classicshaving.com/catalog/item/522941/284057.htm">Merkur HD</a> double-edge razor. I can find a stack of 10 DE blades at the local grocery store for about $2.75.</p>
<p>At the same time, I ordered a bristle brush and shaving soap. For several days I tried shaving in front of a mirror again, but I didn't like it. First of all, I am now used to feeling around my face instead of looking at it. Secondly, as hot as hot lather can be, it is never the same as standing inside a steamy shower; my skin knows the difference. Finally, cleanup is more complicated when I'm already out of the shower. I need to wash bits of soapy lather out of my beard and wash off my face.</p>
<p>So I'm now using the DE razor in the shower. The big difference between a modern cartridge razor and a DE is that the cartridge is on springs that allow it to keep the right angle on your face. With the DE, I need to continually be mindful of the right angle. Of course it's a <em>safety</em> razor, so when the angle is wrong, it simply doesn't shave.</p>
<p>Plus it's just a beautiful piece of equipment. Mechanically simple. Inexpensive blades. Durable. Made out of steel. Doesn't fall apart when you drop it on the floor.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/merkur-hd.jpg" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>I don't desire baby-smooth skin, which most shavegeeks go for. The closer your shave is, the more irritation you will get. So I shave in either one or two passes. The first pass is with the grain and the second pass is perpendicular to the first. I usually completely forgo the final against-the-grain pass that many shavegeeks seem to love. When I am in a hurry I might even skip the second pass, too.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>I asked seven anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians if they would rather have been a typical Indian or a typical European in 1491. None was delighted by the question, because it required judging the past by the standards of today‚Äîa fallacy disparaged as ‚Äúpresentism‚Äù by social scientists. But every one chose to be an Indian.</p>
<p>[...] Imagine‚Äîhere let me now address non-Indian readers‚Äîsomehow meeting a member of the Haudenosaunee from 1491. Is it too much to speculate that beneath the swirling tattoos, asymmetrically trimmed hair, and bedizened robes, you would recognize someone much closer to yourself than your own ancestors?</p>
<p>‚ÄîFrom <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?1400032059/1491"><em>1491</em></a>, by Charles C. Mann</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My current reading project is to get to all those nonfiction books which I've have been meaning to read for years. The last two I read, <em>1491</em> and Jeffrey Sachs's <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0143036580/The+End+of+Poverty"><em>The End of Poverty</em></a> have a common theme: the impact of disease on world events. One of the major points of <em>1491</em> is that our understanding of Native American civilization is skewed by the fact that as many as 95% of them died as a result of Old World disease. One of the major points of <em>The End of Poverty</em> is that many of the places in the world with endemic extreme poverty are in that position mainly as a result of diseases such as malaria and aids.</p>
<p>And it seems so <strong>foreign</strong> to me. I've never lost a single friend or acquaintance to a communicable disease. Cancer, heart disease, old age, emphysema, cirrhosis of the liver: these are the killers I know, not malaria or smallpox.</p>

			<title>Linux F/OSS Gaming Roundup 2006</title>
			<link>https://halcanary.org/vv/2006/11/30/668/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to test out the response time of my new LCD monitor, so I downloaded some games for my Fedora Core 6 system.</p>
<p>All of the games I am reviewing are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Free/Open Source Software, including the game data files. This is a fine distinction that I should explain. For example, Id Software has released the game engines for Doom and Quakes 1, 2, and 3 under the General Public License, but they did not release the game content under a new license. Qfusion is a derivative of the Quake2 engine that is FOSS, but the game Warsaw that makes use of the Qfusion engine comes with proprietary game content, so Warsaw as a whole is not F/OSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Fedora Extras repository. This guarantees that the game will run on my system and if I have a problem, I can file a bug against it at bugzilla.redhat.com. Installation is this easy:</p>
<p>sudo yum install supertux supertuxkart <br />
ppracer prboom freedoom xpilot-ng</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Supertux 0.1.3</strong></p>
<p>Supertux is a game patterned after Super Mario Brothers. If I had a joystick similar to the NES controller (like maybe a Gravis (I used to have one, but I fried it while hacking my USB controller card.)), I'd probably be happier with this game. Or if it was 1986. Then I'd be super psyched about this game and every day all summer I'd go over to Wilson's house and play against him until I learned the game. This game is somewhat monotonous. Setting it in Antarctica limits the color pallet.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2006-11-30-scrnsht-supertux.png" alt="[screenshot]" /></p>
<p><strong>SuperTuxkart 0.2</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://supertuxkart.berlios.de/">Super Tux Kart</a> is a homage to Mario Kart. It features a similar split-screen multiplayer mode. It might be fun to plug two or four USB gamepads into my USB hub and play with friends.</p>
<p><strong>PPRacer 0.3.1</strong></p>
<p>PlanetPenguin Racer is the current version of what used to be called Tux Racer 0.6.1, with a new development team. Not much has changed. It works perfectly on any accelerated video card, including my Radeon 9200+F/OSS driver.</p>
<p>If you've never played it, this is a downhill racing game. It's somewhat fun and fairly challenging.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2006-11-30-scrnsht-ppracer.png" alt="[screenshot]" /></p>
<p><strong>PrBoom v2.4.7 / FreeDoom 0.5</strong></p>
<p>PrBoom is the engine, derived from the Doom engine. FreeDoom is the F/OSS game content for that engine. The graphics for this aren't bad on my Radeon 9200 (with the free radeon driver) as long as you enable the openGL mode.</p>
<pre><code>prboom -vidmode gl
</code></pre>
<p>Caveat: they aren't bad compared to, say the original Doom running on my 386 back in the day. They are primitive compared to quake3 or doom3 but I have yet to get those games to run under the F/OSS driver for my video card. But <code>prboom -vidmode gl</code> is almost as good as OpenGL quake2.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but even after all these years this is a fun game. Who doesn't like to kill demons with a shotgun?</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2006-11-30-scrnsht-prboom.png" alt="[screenshot]" /></p>
<p><strong>xpilot-ng-sdl 4.7.2</strong></p>
<p>XPilot is a fun online multiplayer game. If you played SubSpace on Windows, you've seen a similar game. It's a Multiplayer Online Third Person Shooter (MOTPS). XPilot came out in 1991, had primitive graphics, and only worked on Unix/X11. In 1997, SubSpace was written for Windows: it had much better graphics and had been written from scratch. In 2000, the XPilot NG project was started to update the XPilot graphics system to use SDL/OpenGL (the cross-platform equivalent of DirectDraw/Direct3D).</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2006-11-30-scrnsht-xpilot-ng-sdl.png" alt="[screenshot]" /></p>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<p>There are two multiplayer games I want to test out at some point in the future: OpenArena and Tremulous, both bases on the GPLed Quake3 engine. Tremulous can be downloaded from Fedora Extras. OpenArena cannot yet.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>The first scholars to emerge with a specific culprit in hand were Betty Hart and Todd R. Risley, child psychologists at the University of Kansas, who in 1995 published the results of an intensive research project on language acquisition. Ten years earlier, they recruited 42 families with newborn children in Kansas City, and for the following three years they visited each family once a month, recording absolutely everything that occurred between the child and the parent or parents. The researchers then transcribed each encounter and analyzed each child's language development and each parent's communication style. They found, first, that vocabulary growth differed sharply by class and that the gap between the classes opened early. By age 3, children whose parents were professionals had vocabularies of about 1,100 words, and children whose parents were on welfare had vocabularies of about 525 words. The children's I.Q.'s correlated closely to their vocabularies. The average I.Q. among the professional children was 117, and the welfare children had an average I.Q. of 79.</p>
<p>When Hart and Risley then addressed the question of just what caused those variations, the answer they arrived at was startling. By comparing the vocabulary scores with their observations of each child's home life, they were able to conclude that the size of each child's vocabulary correlated most closely to one simple factor: the number of words the parents spoke to the child. That varied greatly across the homes they visited, and again, it varied by class. In the professional homes, parents directed an average of 487 ‚Äúutterances‚Äù ‚Äî anything from a one-word command to a full soliloquy ‚Äî to their children each hour. In welfare homes, the children heard 178 utterances per hour.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Read <em>Head Rush Ajax</em> yesterday. If you already know Javascript and the DOM, all there is left to learn about the magic of Ajax is the XMLHttpRequest / Msxml2.XMLHTTP / Microsoft.XMLHTTP functions, which aparently all work identically.</p>
<pre><code>/* ajax-http-request.js */
function newHttpRequest() {
  var request = null;
  try {
    request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  } catch (trymicrosoft) {
    try {
      request = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Msxml2.XMLHTTP&quot;);
    } catch (othermicrosoft) {
      try {
         request = new ActiveXObject(&quot;Microsoft.XMLHTTP&quot;);
      } catch (failed) {
        request = null;
        }
    }
  }
  return(request);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Given that simple library file, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>/* some-other-javascript-file.js */
var req = newHttpRequest();
if (req == null)
  alert(&quot;Error creating request object!&quot;);

function dealWithResponse() {
  if (req.readyState == 4) {
    if (req.status == 200)
      doSomethingWith(req.responseText);
    } else {
      throwAnErrorOrSomething();
  }
}
req.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;someurl&quot;, true);
req.onreadystatechange = dealWithResponse;
req.send(null);
</code></pre>
<p>And that's all you really need to know to do Ajax.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've got an ancient computer monitor from 1999. It's a 19&quot; CRT that takes up a large amount of space on my desk. I'm thinking of buying a new LCD monitor. I'd want something with at least the same amount of screen area.</p>
<p>What is state of the art these days?</p>
<p>Concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Image quality for games and movies. What kind of response time do I need?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should I go for 1440x900 or 1280x1024? Which is best for productivity? For movies, the wide screen makes more sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long should I expect a good LCD screen to last?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is an analog connection good enough? How much does a DVI connection improve things? Is it worth the extra moneys?</p>

<p>How much should I expect to spend?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Assume you watch a movie on day 0, mail it on day 1, it gets processed on day 2, and you get a new movie on day 3. Ignore weekends. That is 1 DVD for every 3 days.</p>
<p>Your downspeed bandwidth is for a single-layer DVD is</p>
<pre><code>4.7 x 10^9 bytes / 3 days
= 4700000000*8/3/24/3600 bits/second
= 145062 bit/s
= 145 kbit/s
</code></pre>
<p>That, of course, sucks compared to my 1.5 Mbit/s DSL connection. On the other hand, it is three times better than a 56 kbit/s modem.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A more favorable look: I have a three-disc subscription. 435 kbit/s. Assume all DVDs I get are double-layer. 787 kbit/s. Let's also count the upstream return bandwidth. 1574 kbit/s. Not too shaby.</p>
<p>Conclusion: A significant percentage of the bandwidth to my house comes through the US Postal Service.</p>

<p>Some segments of the Linux user community, which prefer to avoid the IP-encumbered ATI drivers due to ideological choices, still prefer the R200-based chips, as they are among the fastest modern video cards with stable open source drivers.

</blockquote>
<p>My ATI RV280 Radeon 9200 works great with The new Compiz window manager that comes with Fedora Core 6. Using the <code>desktop-effects</code> program, you can replace the old window manager (Metacity) with Compiz. Compiz makes use of neat effects such as the spinning cube and the scaler plugin (similar to OSX's expos√©).</p>
<p>For once, something just works.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code>gconftool-2 --type bool \
  /apps/compiz/plugins/cube/screen0/options/in \

<p>Compiz has more options. It's a bit of a kludge ot change them.</p>

<p>I tried to convence grub to install to /dev/hdb. I had no luck. With lilo that would have been easy. With grub, it's a mystery. Spent lots of time stairing at the grub&gt; prompt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gave up on /sbin/grub-install. Used dd. dd killed my partition table. Apparently, the MBR and the partition table live in the same sector. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovered the partition table using gpart (Guess Partitions?) and some intelegent guesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Went to the store and bought a new 190 GiB (== 204 GB) hard disk. Formatted it with an NTFS partition so I can play World of Warcraft when the need takes me. Left a 142G vFAT partition for cross-OS file transfer and cross-device backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installed XP. Installed basic software and patches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figured out that I could make a bootable Grub CD by with the /usr/share/grub/i386-redhat/stage2_eltorito file. CD boots and I get a grub&gt; prompt. By typing</p>
<p>grub&gt; root (hd1,0)
grub&gt; kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2200.fc5 ro root=/dev/hdb2
grub&gt; initrd /initrd-2.6.18-1.2200.fc5.img
grub&gt; boot</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I can boot up the functional OS on /dev/hdb. There is much rejoicing! So much better than a liveCD.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<p>I wait until FC6 comes out, then fire up bittorrent to get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I install FC6 on /dev/hdb. At the same time, FC6 installer writes wotking grub MBR to /dev/hda. All is well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Review of FC6 to follow.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Thought: Hard disks tend to last long enough for something six times as big to replace them. By which time you won't even miss them.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hard Drive A starts making loud clicking noises yesterday. I suspect it has finally died and I unplug it. Hard Drive B is newer, larger, and containes my day-to-day OS of choice. Tho only problem is that HDB contains no bootloader. So I need to install one. So I boot up knoppix from a CD and fool around trying to install grub. Then I figure I'll just try this:</p>
<pre><code>dd if=boot/grub/stage1 of=/dev/hdb bs=512 count=1
</code></pre>
<p>Of course what I should have done was:</p>
<pre><code>dd if=boot/grub/stage1 of=/dev/hdb1 bs=512 count=1
</code></pre>
<p>I managed to overwrite the partition table of my only working hard drive. Good thing my latest backup is only two weeks old, cause I'm not sure how to access any of the data on the drive.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What I'm watching on TV these days:</p>
<p><strong>Lost</strong><br />
ABC / Wednesdays 9ET/8CT</p>
<p>I started watching this in the third season, after watching the first two seasons on DVD via Netflix. I'm not sure if the third season is going to be good or not. My favorite episodes is still the pilot.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with this type of series is that the writers set up mysteries that are so curious that a reasonable explanation is almost impossible. So they either remain unresolved or are resolved in an unsatisfying way.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>Battlestar Galactica</strong><br />
SciFi / Fridays 9ET/8CT</p>
<p>Going into the third season, a lot has changed in the show, preventing the writers from writing the sort of formulaic episodes that are the norm in most space operas. Maybe they've jumped the shark, but probably they've succeeded in sustaining the feeling of hopelessness and defeat that has defined the series since the Cylons launched a nuclear attack on the Twelve Colonies.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>The Venture Bros.</strong><br />
Adult Swim / Sundays 10:30ET/9:30CT</p>
<p>Adult Swim cartoons range from mind-numbing to somewhat entertaining, with a few exceptions. <em>The Venture Bros</em> is one that I consistently download if I miss an episode. As I've mentioned before, this is a show that I should dislike, since there isn't a single character I admire. The shows main theme, failure, does tend to resonate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps more telling, however, is the sense of societal failure. All around the Venture Compound one sees the artifacts of the Jet / Space Age ‚Äî supersonic nuclear-powered jets, fantastic inventions and gleaming science. But, forty years later, those Jet Age relics are breaking down, and their promises (as well as the paradise that science and technology were to have ushered in) have all been broken. There is perhaps no better symbol of this than Gargantua One, a gigantic space station built by Doctor Jonas Venture, who dubbed it &quot;the ninth wonder of the world&quot;. Intended to be a beacon of scientific advancement and hope for the future, by the present day the station has become completely abandoned except for two astronauts, a sex-starved Romanian woman with a disfigured face and an emasculated, middle-aged virgin. The station has fallen into disrepair, breaking down from only minor complications, and eventually crashes into Earth and explodes (ironically killing numerous members of Al Qaeda; the station's only success was a result of its being a failure). [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venture_Bros.#Failure">source</a>]</p>

<p>The act of simply adding a border-top and border-bottom to an element's style will radically change the distance between it and the preceding and following blocks.

			<title>FC4 version of Clearlooks in FC5</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How to install the Fedora Core 4 version of the default Clearlooks theme on Fedora Core 5 and later:</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/Clearlooks_FC4_example.png" alt="SCREENSHOT OF THEME" /></p>
<p>Begin by going to <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/">http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/</a> and find a mirror. Navigate to the directory <code>core/4/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/</code> to download the two rpm packages we need: gnome-themes-x.xx.x-x.xxx.rpm and gtk2-engines-x.x.x-x.xxxx.rpm</p>
<pre><code>mkdir workingfolder
cd workingfolder
rpm2cpio [PATH]/gnome-themes-2.10.1-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
rpm2cpio [PATH]/gtk2-engines-2.6.3-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
cp -a usr/share/themes/Clearlooks Clearlooks_FC4
</code></pre>
<p>Now we need to edit the files in the Clearlooks_FC4 directory to give this theme a new name so the Theme Manager doesn't get confused. Edit the file <code>Clearlooks_FC4/index.theme</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[Desktop Entry]
Name=Clearlooks_FC4
Type=X-GNOME-Metatheme
Comment=Attractive Usability
Encoding=UTF-8

[X-GNOME-Metatheme]
GtkTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
MetacityTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
IconTheme=Clearlooks
</code></pre>
<p>Edit the file <code>Clearlooks_FC4/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml</code> and change one line:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;Clearlooks_FC4&lt;/name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's wrap this up:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.themes
mv Clearlooks_FC4 ~/.themes
cd ..
rm -r workingfolder
gnome-theme-manager &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could just download my copy of <a href="https://halcanary.org/pub/Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz">Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz</a>.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.themes
tar xzf Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz -C ~/.themes/
gnome-theme-manager &amp;</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was reading some old notes from some math research I did in 2004. I was looking at the Soddy Equation---</p>
<pre><code>(a + b + c + d)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)
</code></pre>
<p>‚Äî which relates the curvatures of four kissing circles (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem">Descartes' theorem</a>). Example of four kissing circles.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2006-09-23-kissers.png" alt="circles touching tangentally" /></p>
<p>Given three kissing circles, one can find two possible fourth circles (it's a quadratic, right?). This makes a cluster algebra-like thing and graphically makes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket">Apollonian gasket</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/apollonian_gasket_example.png" alt="many many circles touching tangentally" /></p>
<p>So far no big suprise. This has all been known since Rene Descartes.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>We had an interesting idea. Draw a Apolonian Gasket. For each of the infinite number of circles in the gasket, perform a circle inversion of all the OTHER circles with respect to that circle. Then plot that out. Repeat the process on all the new circles, ad infinitum. You now have an infinite number of circles, <strong>topologically dense</strong> in R^2, with the property that <strong>no two circles intersect in anyway but tangentially</strong>.</p>
<p>I never came up with a decent way to program a computer to display such a set.</p>
<p>I called this the <strong>Dionysian Gasket</strong>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When we went kayaking, we took along a waterproof disposable camera. This was the first time I've gotten film deveoped in several years, so I din't know what Kodak can do with digitizing these days. The Kodac Picture CD contains a bunch of extranious software, but the images themselves are 1536x1024 JPEGs (1.5 megapixels). I suppose that's close to the limit of 35mm film.</p>
<p>The last time I had photos digitized by the developer was around 1999. I had Seatle Filmworks send me a <em>floppy disc</em> with low-quality 640x480 images in their <a href="http://www.lipman.org/software/sfw/">proprietary format</a>.</p>
<p>For web-purposes, I scaled them down to 900x600. <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2006-09-17">Archive</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Right now I'm not buying new books because i'm in super-thrifty mode. (I did, however buy a new compass (a <a href="http://www.brunton.com/product.php?id=92">Brunton 26DNL</a>) that floats for my next kayacking trip. Not that it is easy to get lost when you are on a river. You're either going upstream or downstream. I bame the DVDs of <em>Lost</em>.) One book that I'm not buying due to the moratorium on new books is <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em> (ISBN 0812976568).</p>
<p>Inside the <em>Gospel</em> are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_of_the_Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Captain_Mosey_and_the_Eight_.22I.27d_Really_Rather_You_Didn.27ts.22">The Eight &quot;I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts&quot;</a>, commandments for Pastafarians. I especially like number 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> I'd Really Rather You Didn't Challenge The Bigoted, Misogynist, Hateful Ideas Of Others On An Empty Stomach. Eat, Then Go After The Bastard.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/book-niven-world-out-of-time.png" alt="[book cover]" /></p>
<p>I finally got around to reading Larry Niven's 1971 novel <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0345336968/A+World+Out+of+Time"><em>A World Out of Time</em></a>. It has a bunch of the really classic sf elements: bussard ramships, the distant future, uploads, distopia, genetic engineering, mobile planets.</p>
<p>The reason I haven't read this one before now is that it has a <strong>really ugly cover</strong>. This one really needs to be republished with a better cover.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2006-09-17</strong>: Since I finished the book I'm been racking my brain trying to remember where I had read about the fusion candle. It was in a <em>Schlock Mercenary</em> <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/d/20030803.html">strip</a> from a couple of years back.</p>
<p>The candle is the most feasible method I've heard for moving planets. It involves improbable engineering, but doesn't involve impossible physics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from pages 200-201 of <em>A World Out of Time</em>:</p>
<p>Two tubes, concentric, each a hundred miles long; the inner tube a mile wide, with thick walls if complex construction; the outer tube thinner and twice as wide. At one end, a bell-shaped rocket nozzle. At the other [...] Reworked military laser cannon, and vents, and a flared skirt, and thick stubby fins, there at the bottom end. Now temporary liquid hydrogen tanks were attached. Now the structure moved under its own power...it was a tremendous fusion motor...moving outward, circled by tiny ships...yeah.</p>
<p>Corbell said, &quot;How do you move the Earth?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are here to tell us that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well it's a problem. A rocket motor won't do the job. You need something that can pull on the entire mass of the planet, nickel-iron core and crust and oceans and air, all at once. Where do you find a force like that?&quot;</p>
<p>[...] &quot;You move something else,&quot; Statholtz said. &quot;The damage done by the rocket's thrust and by mistakes you might make will not kill anyone if nobody lives on the working body. Then the working body can be moved until the world falls toward it as a rock falls to the ground. What was the working body? Ganymede?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uranus. Can you stop the light show at that picture?&quot;</p>
<p>The lecture froze on an &quot;artist's conception&quot;: a blurred, curved arc of Uranus's upper atmosphere. The motor looked tiny floating there. Corbell said, &quot;You see? It's a double-walled tube, very strong under expansion shock. It floats vertical in the upper air. Vents at the bottom let in the air, which is hydrogen and methane and ammonia, hydrogen compounds, like the air that the sun burns. You fire laser cannon up along the axis of the motor, using a color hydrogen won't let through. You get a fusion explosion along the axis.&quot;</p>
<p>[...] &quot;Okay. The hydrogen fusions in the middle of the motor---&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;---and the explosion goes out and up. It's hottest along the axis, cooler when it reaches the walls of the motor. The whole mass blasts out the top, through the flared end. It has to have an exhaust velocity <em>way</em> higher than Uranus's escape velocity. The motor goes smashing into deeper air. You see there's a kind of flared skirt at the bottom. The deep air builds up there at terrific pressure, stops the tube and blasts it back up. You fire it again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Elegant,&quot; says Statholtz.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, Nobody's there to get killed. Control systems in orbit. The atmosphere is fuel and shock absorber both---and the planet is <em>mostly</em> atmosphere. Even when it's off the motor floats high for a while, because it's full of hot hydrogen compounds. If you let if cool off it sinks, of course, but you can bring it back up to high atmosphere by heating the tube with the laser, firing it <em>almost</em> to fusion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's look at the numbers. Suppose that the acceleration is 1/1000 of a gee.</p>
<pre><code>F = m a
  = (8.6832 √ó (10^25)kg) (0.01m/s^2)
  = 8.6832 √ó 10^23 Newtons
</code></pre>
<p>Assume the exhaust velocity averages 300,000 m/s (similar to a VASMIR)</p>
<pre><code>mass flow = F / v
          = (8.6832 √ó 10^23 Newtons)
             /(300000 m/s)
          = 2.8944 √ó 10^18 kg / s
</code></pre>
<p>Which is insanely huge. We'd probably need a bigger exhaust velocity, but I can't imagine it being too much bigger.</p>
<hr />
<p>New back-of-the-envelope calculations on this subject:</p>
<p>Let's say we want to calculate how much thrust you need to move Uranus to Earth's orbit using a standard Hohmann transfer orbit. Ler's only calculate how much thrust it would take to put Uranus into the transfer orbit, ignoring the second half of the problem---taking it out of that orbit.</p>
<pre><code>radius at aphelion = ra = 2.9*(10^12) meters
radius at perhelion = rp = 1.5*(10^11) meters
gravatational constant = gc = 6.67*(10^(-11))
Mass of Sol = ms = 2.0*(10^30)
Delta-Vee at aphelion =
    sqrt(gc*ms/ra) * (1-sqrt(2*rp/(ra+rp)))
</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>bc</code> to do this calculation:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bc -ql
ra=2.9*(10^12);
rp=1.5*(10^11);
gc=6.67*(10^(-11));
ms=2.0*(10^30);
deltavee=sqrt(gc*ms/ra)*(1-sqrt(2*rp/(ra+rp)));
print deltavee, &quot;\n&quot;;
quit;
</code></pre>
<p>The answer was around 4700 m/s. Since the exaust velocity of our engine is 300,000 m/s, we need to use around 1/63rd of the total planetary mass to move it. (300000/4700 = 63).</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I moved my blog over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, which I have been meaning to do for years. It's finally come along to the point where it is fairly usable.</p>
<p><strong>Update.</strong> I've put a lot of effort into writing a decent Wordpress theme for this site. I'm debating releasing this theme back to the community, versus keeping it all to myself.</p>
<p>Yesterday I worked on the comments page. The layout is somewhat reminiscent of the Livejournal comments layout. I am making use of <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">Gravatars</a> for user icons. So if you make a comment and want a fancy icon, be sure to use the same email as you use for your Gravatar account. For those worried about spam-bots harvesting your email from my comments page, don't worry: the Gravatar icon encodes you email in a MD5 one-way function.</p>
<p>I also went through all 614 imported posts and validated the HTML and verified that the import didn't screw up the post too much. That took a long time, but it was necessary. I think I had a lot of invalid HTML out there before the import.</p>
<p>I also wrote a <code>.htaccess</code> file to redirect every one of my old archive pages to the new archive pages. This was necessary because I intend permanent links to be permanent.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you are using CUPS for your printing, there is no reason to continue using Enscript.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
#DTPD#
# http://cups.org/documentation.php/options.html
# ~/bin/lpr-2col-text
exec lpr -o page-left=36 \
        -o page-right=36 \

        -o page-bottom=36 \
        -o columns=2 \
        -o landscape \
        -o cpi=16.842 \
        -o lpi=10.1052 &quot;$@&quot;
# 80 columns width x 70 columns high x 2 columns
</code></pre>
<p>That's about 140 80-character lines per page, in two columns. Somewhat analagous to &quot;enscript -2r -B&quot;. I leave room at the left margin for hole-punches, to make binding easier.</p>
<p>In theory, this should handle Unicode characters much better than enscript or a2ps does. If you are still having issues with unicode printing, try &quot;ooffice - file&quot;.</p>
<p>Here's the one-column version:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>New movies I want to see:</strong></p>
<p><em>A Scanner Darkly</em> ‚Äî I am not a big PKD fan, but I have never failed to enjoy a Philip K. Dick movie adaption (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck).</p>
<p><em>Clerks II</em> ‚Äî Guilty pleasure. I can probably wait for this to come out on DVD, but if I get bored, I might catch it in the theater.</p>
<p><em>My Super Ex-Girlfriend</em> ‚Äî This looks bad, but it might be good.</p>
<p><strong>Movies I've seen so far this summer:</strong></p>
<p><em>X-Men 3</em> ‚Äî The new director did not do nearly as badly as he could have done.</p>
<p><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> ‚Äî Definitely worth seeing. If you are unwilling to shell out a few dollars for a ticket, you can <a href="http://climatechangeaction.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-of-week-al-gore-inconvenient_28.html">download the presentation itself.</a></p>
<p><em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> ‚Äî This was a really slow movie that didn't really go anywhere.</p>
<p><em>Superman Returns</em> ‚Äî It felt like a Superman movie. That's all I really wanted from this one.</p>
<p><em>Dead Man's Chest</em> ‚Äî In adventure stories, the coin of the realm is strangeness. Think of the Barsoom stories.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I am now moved in to the place I'm staying in Florida. About two-thirds of my possessions are in a storage. It took me about 24 hours to unload everything. It took me about 48 hours to drive the 1450+ miles.</p>
<p>This is the route I took to get here: I-90 E / I-39 S / I-55 S / I-74 E / I-57 S / I-24 E / I-75 S. It was fairly direct. I did have to go over the mountain near Sewanee, TN, but the truck made it up and down without melting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One of the most notoriously hazardous stretches of Interstate highway in the United States is approximately 40 miles (64 km) west of Chattanooga on I-24 in Monteagle, Tennessee, where the highway goes over the Cumberland Plateau. Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 4 to 6% grade does not come close to the steepest highway roads (Interstate 40 between Nashville and Knoxville features 5% grades in each direction), but the slope is protracted over a distance of several miles. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.[citation needed] The east bound lanes feature several runaway truck ramps where a truck with no brakes can exit into a long pit full of loose gravel to safely stop. This dangerous stretch of highway inspired Johnny Cash to write a song about Monteagle Mountain.</em></p>
<p><em>Another interesting tidbit about the Monteagle grade is that it sports the widest &quot;median&quot; of any Interstate highway. There's more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend on the other side of the ridge.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_24">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hot here in Florida in the summer. The solution is to (1) simply stay out of the sun or (2) Jump in the pool for five minutes after every hour of work.</p>
<p>That said, I might prefer Florida summers to Wisconsin winters.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I think I'm going sailing with my father. This weekend my extended family will get to town for a one week vacation. After that I will go get a job.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>The latest data, as of March 2006, shows CO2 levels now stand at <strong>381 parts per million (ppm)---100ppm above the pre-industrial average</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite its small concentration, CO2 is a very important component of Earth's atmosphere, because it absorbs infrared radiation at wavelengths of 4.26 ¬µm and 14.99 ¬µm and enhances the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The initial carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the young Earth was produced by volcanic activity; this was essential for a warm and stable climate conducive to life. Volcanic activity now releases about 130 to 230 teragrams (145 million to 255 million short tons) of carbon dioxide each year. <strong>Volcanic releases are about 1% of the amount which is released by human activities.</strong></p>
<p>Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased by approximately 110 ¬µL/L or about 40%, most of it released since 1945. Monthly measurements taken at Mauna Loa since 1958 show an increase from 316 ¬µL/L in that year to 376 ¬µL/L in 2003, an overall increase of 60 ¬µL/L during the 44-year history of the measurements. Burning fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum is the leading cause of increased man-made CO2; deforestation is the second major cause.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#Concentrations_of_CO2_in_atmosphere">SOURCE</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott, the <a href="http://www.chronwatch.com/content/contentDisplay.asp?aid=12594">source</a> you were quoting was simply wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volcanoes also eject the kind of compounds that environmentalists call greenhouse gases. A single eruption the size of the Mt. St. Helens eruption released more of these gases, <strong>dust and ash</strong> into the atmosphere than all such emissions by human activity since the beginning of recorded human history. And there are numerous volcanic eruptions yearly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, he's comparing apples and oranges. Greenhouse gases vs. volcanic ash. Most of what volcanoes spew out is simply ash that falls to the ground over the next few months. And he doesn't cite any of his sources.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How to make iced tea. The one true way.</p>
<p>Any tea that does not use boiling water runs the risk of not killing<br />
the bacteria that might be living in the tea leaves.</p>
<p>prep:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>Make two trays of ice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring about 1.5 quarts of water to a boil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get a two-quart pitcher (Thick high-density polyethylene
(<img src="https://halcanary.org/images/50px-Recycle-resin-logos-lr_02.png" alt="HDPE" />) is<br />
good.) Add two large (6g) tea bags. Add about 5 cups of boiling<br />
water (This will fill the pitcher about 60% of the way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let steep for exactly 5 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove tea bags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional) Add sweetening agent now. This is completely unnecessary.<br />
If you drink unsweetened tea for a while, you will acquire the taste<br />
for it. The most common sweetening agent is sucrose, which should be<br />
classified as a Schedule II Drug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill the pitcher to the 2-quart line by adding<br />
ice cubes. This will bring the tea down to room temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put it the the refrigerator to bring it down further. Or just pour<br />
over ice to cool it immediately.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Drink within 12 hours, or it tastes bad.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> defines a command-line calculator language/interpretor known as<br />
<em>bc</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bc_programming_language">bc</a> is convientent but fairly light on the included math<br />
functions. I wanted a power function that would take floating point<br />
numbers as exponents. bc's basic math library provides the following<br />
functions: sqrt(), sin(), cos(), atan(), ln(), and exp()---abriviated<br />
to sqrt(), s(), c(), a(), l(), and e().</p>
<p>Since</p>
<pre><code>a^b = e^( b * ln(a) ),
</code></pre>
<p>I can define a new fucntion---</p>
<pre><code>define pow(a,b) { return e(b*l(a)); } 
</code></pre>
<p>‚Äî for my power function. While I was at it, I went ahead and created<br />
defininitions for the most common trig functions:</p>
<pre><code>#DTPD#
define ln(a) { return l(a); }
define exp(a) { return e(a); }
define pow(a,b) { return e(b*l(a)); }
define sqrtt(a) { return e(0.5*l(a)); }
define log(a) { return l(a)/l(10); }
define sin(a) { return s(a); }
define cos(a) { return c(a); }
define tan(a) { return s(a)/c(a); }
define sec(a) { return 1/c(a); }
define csc(a) { return 1/s(a); }
define cot(a) { return c(a)/s(a); }
define asin(x) { return a(x/sqrt(1-(x^2))); }
define acos(x) { return a(sqrt(1-(x^2))/x); }
define atan(x) { return a(x); }
define asec(x) { return a(sqrt((x^2)-1)); }
define acsc(x) { return a(1/sqrt((x^2)-1)); }
define acot(x) { return a(1/x);}
define sinh(x) { return (e(x)-e(-x))/2;}
define cosh(x) { return (e(x)+e(-x))/2;}
define tanh(x) { return (e(2*x) - 1)/(e(2*x) + 1); }
define asinh(x) { return l(x+sqrt((x^2)+1)); }
define acosh(x) { return l(x+sqrt((x^2)-1)); }
define atanh(x) { return 0.5*l((1+x)/(1-x)); }
pi = 4*a(1);
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, now that I read more about it I find that I could have just looked up the answers.</p>

<div>Giant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy">elliptical galaxies</a> are probably formed by mergers on a grander scale. In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group" title="Local Group">Local Group</a>, the Milky Way and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M31" title="M31">M31</a> (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy" title="Andromeda Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>) are gravitationally bound, and currently approaching each other at high speed. Since we cannot determine the speed of M31 perpendicular to the line from us to it, we do not know if it will collide with the Milky Way. If the two galaxies do meet they will pass through each other, with gravity distorting both galaxies severely and ejecting some gas, dust and stars into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_space" title="Intergalactic space">intergalactic space</a>. They will travel apart, slow down, and then again be drawn towards each other, and again collide. Eventually both galaxies will have merged completely, streams of gas and dust will be flying through the space near the newly formed giant elliptical galaxy. Out of the gas ejected from the merger, new globular clusters and maybe even new dwarf galaxies may form and become the halo of the elliptical. The globulars from both M31 and the Milky Way will also form part of the halo; globulars are so tightly held together that they are largely immune to large scale galactic interactions. On the stellar scale, little will happen. <strong>If anybody is around to watch the merger</strong> (‚ÄúIf it is on a collision course, the impact is predicted to occur <strong>in about 3 billion years</strong>.‚Äù (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy">S</a>)], <strong>it will be a slow, but magnificent event, with the sight of a distorted M31 spectacularly spanning the entire sky.</strong><br>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution#Elliptical_galaxies">S</a>)</div></blockquote>

<p>GIYF. Going <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html">here</a> skips the player detection. Then one can simply strip the URL from the Page Info dialog, the way God intended.</p>
<p><strong>More background:</strong> I use Fedora Linux as my main OS on my desktop. I have several media players installed---Mplayer, Xine, Realplayer, Ogle, Totem. Some of them will play windows-media-video files without a hitch. The fools who wrote the cnn website assumed that ONLY Windows Media Player would be able to play such files. Jackass.</p>

<p>This is me the day I moved to Madison:</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/photos/1997-09-halface.jpg" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>When I finally move away, will I look like that again?</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>For my upcoming move this summer, I'll be putting a portion of my possessions in storage. After hearing horror stories of people losing many books and papers to water damage, the plan is to line each box with a large garbage bag before filling it up. This way if there is flood damage, I won't lose everything.</p>
<p>Every possession of mine that I can't throw out will be hermetically sealed into boxes lined with garbage bags.</p>
<p>Everything that I don't need in the next six months goes into a storage unit while I figure out my long-term living situation. As I pack books into box after box, I have this feeling that I might not open these boxes for decades.</p>
<p>Sort of like my own personal time capsule. Cool.</p>

I'm awake. The neighbors have stopped playing <em>OK Computer</em> through the wall.
And I just finished Robert Charles Wilson's
<a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0812545249/Chronoliths"><em>Chronoliths</em></a>.</p>
<p>The Plot is similar to <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0765309386/Spin+%28novel%29"><em>Spin</em></a>. Un-understandable cosmic event effects the life of Johnny Everyman, along with the rest of the planet. Eventually, decades later, we find out what the hell happened. Character developnent ensues.</p>
<p>What intersts me is that <em>The Chronoliths</em> plugs directly into this century's zeitgeist, even though it was published in August 2001.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I am a little worried that the two of RCW's books I've read have similar plots and themes. But then again, most authors do that.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I just completed my reading project for the last two weeks. I read four of the five nominees for the 2005
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award">Hugo Award</a> for Best Novel. The fifth book was the _N_th book in a <em>N</em>-book fantasy sequence; I opted not to read that one.</p>
<p>Kudos go to the Madison Public Library, for making this all possible.</p>

<h2><strong>1)</strong> <em>Old Man's War</em>, John Scalzi,</h2>
<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0765315246/Old+Man's+War">ISBN 0765315246</a>, 2005.</p>
<p>This is a fairly simple adventure story and a homage to Heinlein's <em>Starship Troopers</em> (if you are thinking about the movie and not the book, you are misguided and ignorant. Go fix yerself). The twist is that the military recuits are old people given new bodies. Question: aside form their frail old bodies, does the experience of the elderly give them an edge in battle? Who the hell knows. My father quotes my mother's sister's husband's late father: &quot;This getting old business ain't for pussies.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>Old Man's</em> universe is full of clich√©d aliens who want to eat human beings for breakfast. In this sense, it reminded me of Futurama. I suspended disbelief and enjoyed the ride. The characters had an odd point of view: humans fighting humans is pointless and wasteful, but humans fighting aliens is the way the universe works: get used to it or someone will eat you. It is hinted that the Consu keep this part of the galaxy in a perpetual state of war for their own perverted reasons. And this book offers no explanation for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>. Can a book about aliens be considered serious sci-fi if it doesn't aknowledge this querstion?</p>
<p>Good book, but it doesn't deserve the Hugo. There is a sequil, which I will read at some point.</p>

<h2><strong>2)</strong> <em>Learning the World</em>, Ken MacLeod,</h2>
<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0765313316/Learning+the+World">ISBN 0765313316</a>, 2005.</p>
<p>I had wanted to read this for a while, since I've enjoyed MacLeod's other books. This is yer basic Humans-of-the-future- make-first- contact-with- an-industrial-level- alien-species book. The humans come from a post-human society, but are still fairly human. One of the major problems I had with this book was that I didn't really understand the goals of the various political factions within the human expedition. It was explained, but I never really internalized the reasoning.</p>
<p>A neat touch was the fact that one of the protagonists had a blog which the author used to shed light on her actions and how she related to the other characters. I think that MacLeod failed to use this literary tool to its greatest extent.</p>
<p>Overall, I really did't understand the human society at all. Why do stars turn green? I can't imagine a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson swarm</a> that <em>only</em> contains chlorophyll plants. MacLeod has dealt with the technologocal singularity before, but in this book, he ignores that concept completely. I expected more from him.</p>
<p>Overall, this story doesn't compare to some of MacLeod's other books, for example <em>the Cassini Division</em>.</p>

<h2><strong>3)</strong> <em>Accelerando</em>, Charles Stross,</h2>
<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0441014151/Accelerando">ISBN 0441014151</a> 2005.</p>
<p>If I've got
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">the singularity</a> on my mind, the culpret is <em>Accelerando</em>. This book is a series of nine interconnected short stoiries that deal with how we get from here to the singularity and how the singulartity is a trap that many alien societys fall into.</p>
<p>The early chapters might have been written by Cory Doctrow (in fact, the UK version of the cover has a picture of
<a href="http://www.accelerando.org/2005/08/28/">Doctrow on the cover</a>, refering, supposedly, to the fact that character Manfred Macx wears glasses just like Doctrow.</p>
<p>The thing I hated the most about this book is that I don't like any of the characters much at all. Manfred Macx and his daughter Amber are somewhat likeable, but I don't like the people they associate with at all.</p>
<p>The episodic narrative structure allows the story to span several centuries, but allows some stories to sag, pulling down the overall quality. I especially disliked the last story, as it revealed nothing about the central nature of the universe.</p>
<p>Interesting concepts: (1) the metacortex. (2) Legal systems evolve and can change in ways similar to computer systmes. A legal system is the platform on which lawsuits run. (3) AIs can be people under our current legal system, if they are recursivly-owned corporations. (4) Economics 2.0 dehumanizes any entity that wishes to participate. (5) Post-singularity digital beings crave processing power (and consequently, energy), memory, and low-lag bandwidth. Therefore, they will want to live in small-sized Matrioshka brains, and not be prone to explore the galaxy.</p>
<p>This book has the greatest neat-idea density of all the nomimees.</p>

<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/book-rcw-spin.jpg" alt="[bookcover]" /></p>
<h2><strong>4)</strong> <em>Spin</em>, Robert Charles Wilson,</h2>
<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0765309386/Spin+%28novel%29">ISBN 0765309386</a>, 2005.</p>
<p>This is the most literary of the nomines. There was more character development and the images were effective.</p>
<p>The plot is interesting. Anonymous Aliens (the hypotheticals) encase the earth in a giant buble which blocks communication with the outside world and slows down time by a factor of 100,000,000:1.</p>
<p>Interesting ideas: (1) Terraforming Mars can be cheap if you have 100,000,000 years to wait. (2) Most civilizations drown in their own wastes shortly after achieving technology. (3) The universe belongs to self-evolving von-Neuman machines in Stellar Oorts. (4) The fourth-stage of human life is a nod to the Niven Pak Protector, but less inhuman.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I liked the protagonist. I could both identify with and respect his motivations.</p>
<p>I'd give this one the Hugo, if I were a voter. Alas, I avoid fandom like the plague.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I had a thought while reading <em>The Wheel of Time</em> a while back. The series is based on a world with cyclic time, with seven history-destroying cataclysms separating the ages from one another. Some ages have technology, some have magic, some have some combination of the two.</p>
<p>I noticed that there seem to be a lot of fairly effective herbal medicines in use. These must be the result of some genetic engineer thousands of years back deciding to splice the genes for every useful pharmaceutical into various plants. While the drug industry wouldn't survive the fall of civilization, the plants would.</p>
<p>That's not a bad idea.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Alicia Ashman Branch of the Madison Public Library (733 N High Point Rd). Man, it was rich. Expensive wooden shelves. Wood trim everywhere. Lots of space.</p>
<p>Compare to my local branch. Small, dingy. In the summertime, full of kids, waiting in lines for a computer.</p>
<p>The Hawthorn Branch on East Wash was almost as nice as the High Point branch. My local library is the South Madison branch on Park St.</p>

<p>I don't need much from a laptop. A wireless card and a working battery. I am content with my ancient Compaq, even if it is the uncoolest laptop in the room.</p>
<p>Some years ago I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warchalking">warchalking</a>. That fad never became entrenched, and never made it to Madison. If nothing else, the <strong>)(</strong> open hotspot symbol should be used.</p>

<p>I've got a window seat in this coffee shop. It affords me great opportunity for people-watching. Most people are not worth looking at.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>‚ÄúThat was in the contract you agreed to when you bought the DVD.‚Äù I agreed to <strong>nothing!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about this: I can go to the store and buy a five inch reflective disc that holds digital media. If that disc is a music CD, I can pop it in my computer, encode it, put it on my iPod, and listen to it whenever I like. But if that disc is a movie DVD, I cannot, even though the same iPod is perfectly capable of playing the same digital content that I own just the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(Oh, and by the way, Apple created a billion dollar industry in legal song downloading because of this. Where's the Apple Movie Store? Ask the MPAA.)</p>
<p>Now, being the geek I am, I know I can encode movies and do what I just described. But I've got to use one of a handful of quasi-legal programs. The MPAA doesn't want me to do that, and they've threatened legal action against those that do. Plus, there's no way to do it using the same tools that came with my computer and iPod (namely iTunes) because of that same legal threat.</p>
<p>The audience was filled with other examples of an industry gone crazy. One guy moved to the UK and all his DVDs stopped working because they were region-encoded (as most are). Her answer? That was in the contract you agreed to when you bought the DVD. Another guy asked why he can't just download the Sopranos. After all, he's a HBO subscriber, so he paid for it, he just happened to miss the last episode. Her answer, again, was that the time is part of the contract. My answer: Give it a couple years and HBO will be doing this, or they'll be out of business.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Spent a load of money on my car today. Battery, belt, &amp; oil. It's probably all worth it.</p>
<p>I've also decided to reread <a href="http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=050124">‚ÄúOceans Unmoving‚Äù</a> because it made no sense the first time through. It's a good self-contained story. (I'm assuming that it will end in the next week or so.) It reads better as <em>comic book</em> than as a <em>daily comic strip</em>. The author would also benefit from more editorial input.</p>
<p>This weekend, I watched the first series of <a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/directory/977/tv/it+crowd+%28the%29"><em>The IT Crowd</em></a>. Some of it was brilliant, and some of it was less so. The first episode is my current favorite.</p>
<p>I believe that every TV show should have limited runs. Tell your story, do a handful of variations on your theme, then end it. Bringing back <em>Family Guy</em> was probly a mistake; the new episodes don't add much. That said, there are no hard-and-fast rules on how many episodes is enough. <em>FMA</em> tells a single story in fifty-one episodes. Most sitcoms should be ended after a dozen episodes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Convoluted Story:</p>
<p>I had an hour or so to kill on the westside between shifts this week, so I stopped in the big bookstore they have. Glancing through the new fiction paperbacks, I saw <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0060987103/Wicked+%28Maguire+novel%29"><em>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em></a>. Someone had recommended it some time ago, saying &quot;it's more political than I would have expected.&quot; I forget who.</p>
<p>So I picked it up, read the first two chapters, and fell asleep in the comfy chairs they have. After they called me back into work, I bought the book.</p>
<p>I don't know why I liked the book, but here's a guess: the protagonist is flawed in ways that I can identify with.</p>
<p>I wanted to read up on the source material, which has fallen into the public domain. So I downloaded the text from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>
<p>The best way I have to read ebooks is on my palm m105. I can do this flat on my back, which is how I like to read anyways. I'd get a fancier PDA, but I can't justify spending money if all I do is read books on the damn thing.</p>
<p>The m105 has some advantages and disadvantages. It was relatively cheap at the time it was released, and made a nice graduation present from my parents. It uses 2xAAA batteries, so I don't have to worry about the lifetime of a rechargeable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it uses old-fashioned RAM for its memory and when the batteries die, the memory is all lost. So every time that happens, I have to reinstall databases and applications. I've tried to make that as easy as possible: The directories $HOME/Palm/Docs and $HOME/Palm/Apps contain PalmDoc ebooks and Palm applications. The pilot-link tools make re-installing everything easy. <code>PILOTPORT=/dev/ttyS0 PILOTRATE=115200 pilot-xfer -i ~/Palm/Docs/* ~/Palm/Apps/*</code></p>
<p>I do wish I had one of the models that relied on a removable Flash drive and not RAM.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For my birthday, the folks gave me a <a href="http://www.etoncorp.co.uk/fr250.html">radio with built-in dynamo</a>. I've wanted one of these for years. 90 seconds of cranking is supposed to provide an hour of music.</p>
<p>One can also charge a cellphone with the dynamo. But not <em>my</em> cell phone, because every cell phone uses a unique connector.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The last few days I've felt amazingly <strong>good</strong>. I've been waking up early, around 08:00 or 09:00, getting the right amount of caffeine (2L of DC are $.89 at Woodman's this week.), and sleeping nine or ten hours a day. The down side is that I've been falling asleep right after work every night.</p>
<p>It's nice not to sleep through most of the nine-hour day.</p>
<p>I may even finish cleaning the Fortress of Solitude today.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Driving around in the snow last night was stressful. Maybe I'll get used to it. But I had no mishaps.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I'm going to wait until it warms up a few more degrees before I go outside and change the headlight on the car.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>How could you ever use a text editor without the downcase-word, upcase-word, and capitalize-word functions? In Emacs it's Alt-l, Alt-u, and Alt-c.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we took the ferry down to Key West. In restrospect, this was a bad idea. Thre and a half hours each way, compared to spending five hours on the island.</p>
<p>The water was choppy. I spent the trip back emptying my stomach into a sequence of small bags.</p>
<p>I think I still have hydrocloric acid in my sinuses.</p>
<p>The key lime pie was no better in the keys than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Went to the <a href="http://www.audubon.org/local/sanctuary/corkscrew/">Corkscrew Swamp Sactuary</a>. The most interesting point in the 2.25 mi hike is when a sign asks you to stop and smell the air. It was possibly the cleanest air you have ever smelled. The sign then quoted a writer from three hundred years ago, who says swamps are places of foul air, disease and decay.</p>
<p>I used to live a few miles from a cypress swamp. It was a cool place.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I just read Stephen Baxter's <a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0345430786/Manifold+Trilogy"><em>Manifold Space</em></a>. I picked it up on the theory that it wouldn't be as depressing as Baxter's other novels. I'm not sure why I expected that. The ending was just as just as morbid as the others. Plot summary: life sucks, then you have depressing adventures in space, then you die, then the human race becomes extinct, then the universe is destroyed.</p>
<p>It's the anti-startrek.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Google employee: ‚ÄúWe are not scanning all those books to be read by people; we are scanning them to be read by an AI.‚Äù</p>
<p>George Dyson: ‚ÄúFor 30 years I have been wondering, what indication of its existence might we expect from a true AI? Certainly not any explicit revelation, which might spark a movement to pull the plug. Anomalous accumulation or creation of wealth might be a sign, or an unquenchable thirst for raw information, storage space, and processing cycles, or a concerted attempt to secure an uninterrupted, autonomous power supply. But the real sign, I suspect, would be a circle of cheerful, contented, intellectually and physically well-nourished people surrounding the AI. There wouldn't be any need for True Believers, or the downloading of human brains or anything sinister like that: just a gradual, gentle, pervasive and mutually beneficial contact between us and a growing something else.‚Äú</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Last week I was reading an article about Miers' main qualification as a Supreme Court nominee being, as it is with all Bush appointees, personal loyalty to the president. This criteria makes a Machiavellian sort of sense when applied to cronies you're going to make cabinet secretaries or bureau chiefs, but I couldn't figure out why you'd require personal loyalty from someone you were selecting for a lifetime appointment... <em>unless</em>, I realized, you <em>also</em> intended to be in office for life. That's when I realized: they have no intention of leaving office. No way in hell are they taking any chance of losing an election with some other candidate. They are entrenched in the White House for good.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/book-building-moon.jpg" alt="[cover]" />I picked up Larry Niven and Brenda Cooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765312662/ref%3Dnosim/theworldofhalcan/"><em>Building Harlequin's Moon</em></a>. I'm only a third of the way through it.</p>
<p>Impressions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It reminds me a bit of the brainstorming I was doing the other week, without the aliens.</li>
<li>It sets up a situation where you can <em>almost</em> understand why people create an abomination: slavery. Until, of cource, the protagonist gets sold down the river.</li>
<li>It also has a theme of a society that has found that it can not safely advance its technology anymore. If the technological singularity exists and is to be feared, then this is a theme we need to think on.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>So I've had this setup for a scifi novel kicking around in my head for a while.</p>
<p>The story begins on earth, roughly 30 years from now. Explorers arrive from interstellar space and tell the Earthicans that they need to buy material to refit, refuel, and relaunch their starship. They will trade information and technology for the material, but it will not be cheap. Earthicans must put tonnes into orbit for each small bit of tech. Fortunately, the project bootstraps itself. Once earth acquires fusion power and a skyhook, they will be home free.</p>
<p>Side plot: Earth of the future is pretty bad. Wars over energy are routine. People are starving in the US. NASA is long since de-funded. The explorers are sad, but detached. Their mission is not charity.</p>
<p>The other main plot: We tell the story from the point of view of the interstellar explorers, whom the Earthicans never get to see face-to-face. The explorers are solid-state beings living in the computers of the starship. This is the only way to build starships, there is no room on board for living beings.</p>
<p>But the explorers were once physical beings. They live in a rich virtual world, where they envision themselves as the crew of a scifi starship from television shows from their own past.</p>
<p>Possible ideas for conflict: Maybe the effort to restart a space program that will undoubtedly cause short-term deaths. Maybe the new space race leads to wars on earth, even as the end of war is within grasp. Maybe most Earthicans hate and fear the ETs and do not want to trade with them. Maybe once Earthicans find out that they are not &quot;alive&quot; as they understand it (re: culture of life), Earthicans refuse to trade with them.</p>
<p>Side plot: The explorers mission is---so far---a failure. They have visited half-a-dozen systems in search of more advanced technology. So far they have found nothing. They and other groups of explorers find a lot of empty systems and some dead civilizations (most died off with a nuclear holocaust, others at other stages in civilization). Several declined civilizations (These are tough for the explorers: they must spend a lot of time and become archaeologists in search of tech they don't know exists or not.) And several civilizations like earth, that have become stagnate. As much as they act indifferent to the humans, they are secretly collecting as much information as possible (TV signals, later they tap into the Internet (how?)).</p>
<p>Bibliography:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Childhood's End</em>. Aliens who don't reveal themselves for fear that earthlings will fear them.</li>
<li><em>The Fountains of Paradise</em>. Space elevator. Starship<br />
refit.</li>
<li>Anything to do with Transhumanism. Uploaded Solid State<br />
intelligences.</li>
<li><em>Star Trek: First Contact + Enterprise</em>. 21st century Vulcan/Human<br />
interaction.</li>
<li><em>Contact</em>. Of course. I never liked the ending, though.</li>
<li><em>Battlestar Galactica</em>. Can a toaster be a person?</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I list a bibliography to (1) resolve any accusation that I steal ideas from somewhere. Of course I do. (2) list those works that I would like to disassemble. Most of these have underlying assumptions that wish to explore.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, my name is Hal, and I'm a computer geek.</p>
<p>I've been trying to limit my spending on computer hardware of late. I have mostly been successful. But that didn't stop me from spending $30 on a whim last night.</p>
<p>I had been using my flash drive a lot recently, and was getting sick of reaching around my case to blindly fumble wityh the USB port. The same goes for every other USB perifrial, such as the external HDD or the camera.</p>
<p>I either needed to get a case with front ports or a hub. I bought a Belkin <a href="http://tinyurl.com/coug4">F5U233-APL</a> USB2 4-Port Hub.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2005-09-21-belkin-hub.jpg" alt="[hub pic]" /></p>
<p>It was, I think, orignally designed to act as a dock for an ipod shuffle: it has a port on the top of the device. This port works well for any bulky USB device.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I love the <em>concept</em> of USB? There is a limit on how many USB devices one computer can handle. 127 devices. Maybe you don't remember the bad old days, when computers had one paralell port and one serial port. If you tried to add more devices, you ran into IRQ issues and had to start playing with jumpers. My family had two computers, networked using a paralell-port nullmodem. But we also had two printers which used the paralell ports as well. The system worked, but there were kludges involved.</p>

<p>When I made the second, I did it on thick watercolor paper instead of thin drawing paper. The inking went a lot faster because I used a better pen. I also made a point to draw fewer lines, under the assumption that I could do more shading with the wash. I also used a different brush for the second one. That was a mistake, I should have used my better brush.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I got a package from the folks today. It contained a few xeroxed articles and, strangely, two seven-inch sticks of bamboo. &quot;Bamboo? What the huh?&quot; I thought, then rushed out the door to work.</p>
<p>This evening, I bothered looking through the articles. The bamboo, it seems, is the answer to a question I had asked Mom about ink+watercolors drawings. According to the article (Mom didn't give me a proper reference):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 'pen' I use is generally a matchstick thrust into a short length of bamboo, which I then sharpen with a razor blade or craft knife---the actual shape is the one that works best in a situation...</p>

<p>Ah ha. I need to pick up some india ink.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many cities are designed on a Cartesian plan: north-south streets and east-west streets. Madison is on a double-Cartesian plan: N-S, E-W, NW-SE, and NE-SW streets all jumbled together.</p>
<p>If you want to go northeast, it is nice to be able to get there, but it does tend to make the city confusing.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about other ways of doing it. instead of four and instead of eight direction, how about six? E-W, NW-SE, and NE-SW, where NW is really closer to 60 degrees, not 45 degrees.</p>
<p>You would end up with something that looks like a honeycomb. Then I pull in another idea: If neighborhoods are well-defined, does that make neighborhoods more cohesive? Would it help if I put definite borders between them? Why not space them a bit? Put in parkland to separate them.</p>
<p>Here's the plan:<br />
<img src="https://halcanary.org/images/city-grid-2c.png" alt="[city plan]" /><br />
white = urban (residential/commercial) and high-density suburban zones.<br />
dark green = parkland (either wooded or grassy)<br />
light green = paved bike and walking paths.<br />
heavy black lines = major boulevards (connects neighborhoods)<br />
light black lines = avenues (minor streets not pictured)<br />
blue lines = mass transit (elevated rail or subway) (connects neighborhoods)</p>
<p>The scale is on the order of one to two miles. This does not take into acount the unique topography of every location. The plan would need to be adapted.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever built a city with mass transit designed in from the beginning? Is it always an afterthought?</p>
<p>The thing I love the most about this plan is that one could walk from one end of the city to the other and never leave parkland.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><em>Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,<br />
Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,<br />
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At 11 p.m. of August 29, Mayor Ray Nagin conducted an interview with WWL [23] discussing the damage to New Orleans. He described New Orleans as &quot;totally dark&quot; with no clear way in or out, with eighty percent of the city flooded with some areas with water depths of 20 feet. Both airports are underwater, &quot;three, huge boats&quot; are run aground, along with an oil tanker which is leaking oil. The yacht club was destroyed by a fire, and that gas leaks are reported throughout the city. The Pontchartrain Expressway (referring to Interstate 10 east of the city, not the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway) is &quot;full of water&quot; and the Twin Spans are &quot;totally destroyed.&quot; He described the loss of life as &quot;significant&quot; with reports of bodies floating on the water throughout the city, though primarily in the eastern portions. There is no clean water or electricity in the city, and some hotels and hospitals reporting diesel fuel shortages. The estimate of restoration of power is at least 4-6 weeks for the city. The breach in the levy at the 17th street canal is causing further trouble, as the pumps which are pumping water out of the city are pumping it into Lake Pontchartrain, which would be held off by the levy that is now broken, negating the effectiveness of those systems. The I-10 pumps were on for days and overheated, causing valve damage, also negating their effectiveness during the flooding. A representative from St. Bernard reported &quot;total devastation&quot; with 40,000 homes flooded. The National Guard has begun setting up temporary morgues in select locations. He also said houses have been picked up and moved. In summary, he described the devastation as a &quot;nightmare.&quot; He also said that 20,000 people were currently in the Superdome.</p>
<p>As of 11:30 p.m. CDT, WDSU-TV reported at least part of the I-10 Twin Span has completely collapsed. On WWL-TV, Mayor Nagin stated that, according to a FEMA official, the entire length of the Twin Span had been destroyed. [24] There is also a large fire involving several large building complexes.</p>
<p>On August 30 at 1:30 a.m. CDT CNN (via the vice president of Tulane University Medical Center) reported that a levee on the 17th Street Canal, which connects into Lake Pontchartrain has suffered a two city-block wide breach in it. This is allowing the water of Lake Pontchartrain, which lies some six feet above sea level, to flow downward into northern New Orleans proper, which lies between two and ten feet below sea level. The administrator reported that the water level had been rising at a rate of one inch every five minutes, and that the water had already flooded the first floor of Tulane University Medical Center and was approaching the second floor where the emergency generators for the hospital are located. The Vice President reported that the hospital needed immediate evacuation and with surface roads inundated, airlift via the heliport at the hospital will be the only way to rescue the some one thousand patients and staff still at the hospital. Charity Hospital, located east of Tulane, is also preparing to evacuate. A 200 ft breach was confirmed by New Orleans Fire Department officials to CNN at 3:16 a.m. CDT. [25].</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone">could be worse...</a></p>
<p>I keep thinking that now would be the time to bulldoze the city and rebuild it... 20 to 30 feet higher.</p>

Subject: The status of your Baxter diamonds paper with E-JC</p>
<p>Dear Dr. Canary,</p>
<p>We are sorry that your paper is taking so long to process.<br />
It is now with its 4th referee, who has had it since July 27<br />
this year. The other referees failed to deliver; in particular<br />
referee #2 kept promising for a year until I gave up on him.<br />
I'm hopeful that the current referee will break the pattern,<br />
but in any case I won't be so patient this time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I got into an argument with a certain unnamed environmentalist the other day. I was arguing that when we (humanity) start to run low on petroleum and natural gas over the next thirty years, we will have to become more reliant of nuclear fission as a source of energy.</p>
<p>The only other options are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliance on coal. Unfortunately, coal releases more CO2 into the environment per unit of energy than natural gas, so the more that we rely on coal, the more we accelerate global warming. Burning sulfur-√¢‚Ç¨‚Äπcontaining coal also contributes to acid rain. If you don't think that acid rain is a bigger problem than radioactive waste, go visit Appalachia.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, we will have to use more coal whether we like it or not.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Reliance on wind and solar. These will have to be a big part of our plans, but the infrastructure will be expensive and take a long time to build. Kunstler argues that these things can not be built without cheap energy and so will never be built. I am less pessimistic than he. In an ideal world, the feds would be creating a TVA-like organization to issue bonds and start building, even it they won't turn a profit for fifty years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a lot less energy. We can save a lot of energy just by doing two things: outlawing pizza delivery and forcing everyone to take the bus to work. (TWAJS.) But in the end, we need a lot of energy to fix nitrogen to fertilize crops to feed the six+ billion people on the planet. The only other option is to allow a few billion to starve to death. Is that what you want?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Organic farming will never feed six billion people. (Dear organic farmers, please prove me wrong.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Wait for fusion. Good plan. Santa Clause will put it in you stocking next Christmas. With the Toothfairy's help. (Dear plasma physicists, please prove me wrong.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hydrogen economy. That Was A Joke Son.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No, I am not stuck in 1950. Nuclear energy is not cheap and does produce toxic byproducts. But we can deal with those byproducts. It's just radioactivity. Stay away and keep it out of the atmosphere, groundwater, and the hands of terrorists.</p>
<p>No, I'm not an environmentalist any more. I am a realist. We should do what we have to do to keep billions of people from starving.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>He [Jared Diamond] elaborated a bit on his book's account of the Easter Island collapse, where a society that could build 80-ton statues 33 feet high and drag them 12 miles, and who could navigate the Pacific Ocean to and from the most remote islands in the world, could also cut down their rich rain forest and doom themselves utterly. With no trees left for fishing canoes, the Easter Islanders turned to devouring each other. The appropriate insult to madden a member of a rival clan was, &quot;The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth!&quot; The population fell by 90% in a few years, and neither the society nor the island ecology have recovered in the 300 years since.</p>
<p>Diamond reported that his students at UCLA tried to imagine how the guy who cut down the LAST tree in 1680 justified his actions. What did he say? Their candidate quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fear not. Our advancing technology will solve this problem.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;This is MY tree, MY property! I can do what I want with it.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Your environmentalist concerns are exaggerated. We need more research.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Just have faith. God will provide.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>‚Äî Summarized by Stewart Brand (<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/07/on_failing_to_t.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was Jared Diamond's take on the impending end of things. I've <a href="/vv/2005/05/26/464/">already made that analogy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://billmon.org/archives/002056.html">Via Billmon</a>, who has more to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ordinarily, I'd be the last one to challenge Jared Diamond's thinking -- the man is a genius. But in this case I have to wonder if he isn't overanalyzing things. Maybe the reason humans act so dumb isn't because of their intellectual frame of reference, or their clan structure, or because they lack historical awareness. Maybe people act dumb because a lot of them are dumb -- dumb as turnips. So stupid they have trouble each morning remembering that their shoes go on their feet. So mentally challenged they have to use crib notes to remember their ABCs. So monumentally dense they can't even do the job of a cable news talk show host -- or at least not properly. Borderline vegetative, in other words.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I've noticed a trend in TV scifi. Helmets on pressure suits don't have headlamps on the outside, they have lamps on the <strong>inside</strong> of the helmet, illuminating the face.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2005-07-21-headlamp.jpg" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>This makes sense from a TV point of view: You can tell who is in the suit. But in reality, a bright light inside the suit would turn the faceplate into a mirror. The actors can't see a thing.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When I got home last night the computer was off but the green light was still on. I had to cycle the power, not just reboot. When it happened again after only a few minutes, I figured that it had overheated. (1) Modern mobos have thermometers and shut off when the CPU gets too hot. (2) I had my AC off and windows open in the apartment for a few days to save energy. (After a while, you get used to the heat. And the natural layer of sweat.) (3) The computer seemed quieter than normal (this is hard to judge); maybe the fan was out.</p>
<p>So I went to get a new case fan. This one is much quieter than the old one that came with the case four years ago. While I was at the store, I picked up some comressed air, figuring that dust was the likely culpret. I'll try and clean the case every time I open it from now on. Maybe I should think of compressed air a s acleaning product, like soap or windex: something I should always have on hand. Maybe I should make a point to clean every computer every six months.</p>
<p>I hope this computer doesn't die in the next few minutes. Then I would have to find the real problem.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2005-08-15:</strong> Turn out that the power supply needed to be replaced. I'm not so competent.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Many analysts have noted the transformation of Al Qaeda from an organization to a movement---that is, from a top-down, centrally directed terrorist group to a decentralized &quot;franchise&quot; operation, in which local operators like Abu Zarqawi and the Madrid bombers make their own plans and pursue their own tactical objectives.</p>
<p>John Robb, the systems analyst behind the blog <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2005/07/journal__a_caut.html">Global Guerrillas</a>, argues that this evolution may actually have <em>improved</em> Al Qaeda's long-term survivability and operational effectiveness, even if it rules out large, complex attacks like 9/11. A highly decentralized network of terrorist cells, he argues, can use something analogous to market mechanisms to coordinate its actions---learning to avoid the mistakes and imitate the successes of other cells.</p>
<p>If true, it could mark the birth of an entirely new type of conflict---a &quot;fifth generation&quot; warfare in which the enemy not only isn't a nation state, but isn't even an <em>entity</em> ‚Äî like the Viet Cong or the Shining Path or the PLO. It's almost impossible to imagine how a security establishment that yet hasn't learned how to fight a fourth generation insurgency is going to cope with that.</p>
<p>‚Äî Billmon (<a href="http://billmon.org/archives/001986.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The franchise and the virus work on the same principle: what thrives in one place with thrive in another. You just have to find a sufficiently virulent business plan, condense it into a three-ring binder - its DNA - xerox it, and embed it in the fertile lining of a well-traveled highway, preferably one with a left-turn lane. Then the growth will expand until it runs up against its property lines.</p>
<p>‚Äî NS (<a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0553380958/Snow+Crash">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Terror is now nothing more than a franchise---anyone with a high school education, access to a public library (you don't even need to check books out), and a grudge can start a cell---then we need to rethink how we deal with it. How do you deal with spoiled brats who throw tantrums? Ignore them.</p>
<p>What do these kids want? (1) They want to be on TV. (2) They want you to be afraid of them.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What does grokster mean for free software? How can this be related?</p>
<p>Remember that Grokster is a for-profit company that distributes a proprietary P2P application. Since the software only comes from the company, it can be destroyed by destroying the company (id est through legal action against the company).</p>
<p>Contrast this with a F/OSS program like bittorrent, which is based on an open protocol. Since the protocol is open, there are many implementations, so each developer would need to hunted down individually by the MPAA/RIAA. Grokster must operate legally in the united states if they are to collect money from americans. As long as servers exist outside of the US, illegal software can still be developed. Exempli gratia LAME versus Fraunhofer.</p>
<p>Could pirates continue to use proprietary software? Yes, but KAZAA has taught us not to trust proprietary software. People trusted grokster because a company stood behind their product and guaranteed that they would not bundle spyware.</p>
<p>The only reason that we trust Microsoft Office not to contain spyware is that MSFT has so much to lose if they were found out.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm pretty happy with my current recipe for Miso soup.</p>
<p>Serves 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>0.5 tsp Dashi (I've got Hon-dashi, which is a bonito broth.)</li>
<li>2 Green Onions</li>
<li>1 tsp Miso Paste (I have Yamabuki Tezukuri Miso.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Put a bowlful of water into a small pot. Heat to boiling. Cut the green onions up and throw them in. If you let them cook for a little while I think they add more flavor. Throw the dashi in as soon as it begins to boil. Add the miso next and turn off the heat. Stir. As soon as the miso is disolved, serve. Overcooking the miso or dashi will destroy those flavors.</p>

<p>Last Friday I want to see some really horrible bands, folowed by a good band. There may or may not have been a ninja attack.</p>
<p>Saturday I worked and avoided the universe.</p>
<p>Sunday I vegged.</p>
<p>Monday was Memorial day. I went on a 15 mile bike ride, meeting up with J and with S and H for parts of it. I was in pain by the end of it. My butt was sore for a couple of days.</p>
<p>I avoided the uiverse for the next few days. I did manage to visit with friends Wednesday, though.</p>
<p>This week has not been a highly profitable one in the world of pizza delivery. Something about the first of the month attracts those people who are least likely to tip the driver at all.</p>
<p>Tonight we were over-staffed and I went home early. I was productive and cleaned a lot of my apartment.</p>
<p>Plans for tommorrow (today): Up early, clean, bicycle downtown for brunch, stopping at the post office and at the bank on my way. Stop by the Uni library for some rare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith">Doc Smith</a> books. Bike home. Go to B+N's if time permits. Go to work. Overcaffinate myself. Stay up all night. Work on some schoolwork sunday.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Story:</p>
<p>Some units of time (18 months? Four years? Does it matter?) ago I was in Virginia visiting relatives. I got to hang with my cousin's three kids. They were playing the card game bullshit--which they called something else, because they were very proper children. (I still yelled &quot;BULLSHIT!&quot; when appropriate. They were shocked.)</p>
<p>After they switched to war---the worst card game ever---I refused to play. Instead, I taught them to play hearts. The youngest (maybe seven at the time) never developed any strategy for the game, and the middle child's meds wore off halfway through the game, but I enjoyed playing a real game.</p>
<p>Why am I thinking about card games recently?</p>
<p>Last month, I wandered through the Westside GenericMegaBookstore and I saw a book, <em>The Pocket Idiot's Guide to Texas Hold'em</em> (Should be <em>The Idiot's Pocket Guide to ...</em>). I bought it and enjoyed it a lot. It stressed the mathematics behind the game of poker. (Do not ever play a betting game if you are unfamiliar with the concept of expectation value.)</p>
<p>Last semester, we played <a href="http://www.setgame.com/set/">Set</a> in my methods class.</p>
<p>My boss at the pizza place quit smoking recently. He immediately took the money he saved and bought lotto tickets. I almost explained the notion of expectation value to him. Instead, I just told him that if I am going to gamble, I prefer to play games where skill can make a difference.</p>
<p>This all got me thinking about invented games, like William Shroyer's Clubs. (All games are invented. I just was friends with Wes in High school.) Webb reminded me of his game Sparts. We didn't like Sparts because it was to baroque.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about game theory, game design, gambling, and mathematics.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Background:</p>
<p>The trustees of the Social Security Administration have traditionally used demographic, economic, and fiscal models that end after 75 years. The idea is that there simply is no way to accurately predict the future beyond that. (Aside: can't we fix the long-term problems of SocSec by making _demographic_ changes? Exempli gratia: increase immigration.) The current administration made waves this year by integrating these numbers out to infinity to overstate the crisis.</p>
<p>Notion:</p>
<p>We (society as a whole) would be irresponsible if we did NOT plan for the future---at least 75 years out. On the other hand it would be a waste of time to plan beyond 75 years.</p>
<p>Discuss.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week I had no work Monday to Wednesday. My original plan was to drive into he woods and camp by myself. I ended up staying in Madison and hanging out with Sebastien and pretending to be an artist.</p>
<p>My sketchpad is now full of crappy drawings.</p>
<p>Sebastien is moving away end of summer. Entropy, you know.</p>
<p>My internet was out last week. That helped me spend more time<br />
outside.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am kinda depressed over school. I'm not a very good student anymore. Positive Hal says that there is little to no correlation between being a good education student and being a good educator. Negative Hal would like to point out that the Department of Public Instruction disagrees.</p>
<hr />
<p>I rented <em>Saved</em> and <em>Solaris</em> last night. Those were both movies that I had missed because life seemed more important than watching movies at the time. I give them each a B.</p>
<p>There was a point in time when I watched almost every new movie that hit the theaters. I went to the $3 5pm matinee+stale popcorn+flat coke deal at the Cinema Showcase Twelve at least once a week. And if midnight rolled around and we wanted to see a movie, they always had midnight shows.</p>
<p>That was twelfth grade for me. A lot of poker. A lot of spades/hearts/clubs. A lot of console gaming. A lot of 5pm movies. A lot of eight ball. A lot of hanging out in the school parking lot. A lot of watching the sunset on a city of trees from Noble's eighth-floor balcony. A lot of the god-forsaken Imperial Society of Stapleremovers. A lot of wonderfully wasted time.</p>
<p>Stupid memory lane.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm taking a couple of summer classes. In series, not parallel. The first one is &quot;Principles of Career and Vocational Education&quot;. There are 10.5 hours total classroom hours. A two credit class normally spends three times that long in class. I might grow to love summer classes.</p>
<p>The delivery job goes well. If my mind continues to deteriorate, I think I would like to do deliveries or drive a cab as a career. Probably not food for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I now have Sundays off. Not this weekend, but maybe next, I'll organize a poker night. This time, I promise not to cancel, even if no one shows up.</p>
<p>Sara left town this week, taking away access to her canoe. She said we were going to go canoeing. Liar.</p>
<hr />
<p>I will be visiting faily and backpacking in East Tennessee the first two weeks of August. That will be fun. Except maybe for the family part.</p>
<hr />
<p>This evening will be spent deleting trash off of the hard drive, cleaning the house, laundry, and cleaning the beer out of my good clickity keyboard. Maybe I'll leave the house, too.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I stopped reading my mail a while back. If something is important, like a letter from family or a bill that MUST be paid, I might dig through the pile of spam for it. But most bills go a few months without payment. I have unopened bank statements from last year.</p>
<p>I used to be so responsible. Eight years ago I BALANCED MY CHECKBOOK.</p>
<p>Poll: Should I start being responsible with money again?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You may or may not have noticed that I have started cross-posting a subset of the WoHC Log to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22hal+canary%22+site%3Alivejournal.com">Livejournal.</a> There are a lot of people who simply refuse to read or comment on a post that isn't on Lj. Some of these people are my friends. I guess that's why I have gaim set up for four different accounts on four different instant messaging protocols (jabber/icq/aim/yahoo).</p>
<p>Some topics will not be cross-posted. In general, the more geeky a subject is, the less likely it is to be cross-posted.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Wednesday I stayed up late in a misguided attempt to enjoy my life. Even thought I only had to be at work by 10am, I was still groggy. A short nap in the afternoon before the other work didn't help much. Friday I had to get before 6 and drive to <a href="http://www.wismath.org/GL.html">Green Lake</a>. As soon as I got back, I went to work. All day Thursday and all day Friday I was short on sleep. Not enough to kill anyone, just enough that I was operating at less then 100%.</p>
<p>I just slept for about 10 hours. Nice.</p>
<p>Today, I'm going to go get the oil changed in the jeep (he's been subtly complaining about his dirty oil for weeks). Then I'm going to go take advantage of <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/">free comic book day</a>. At noon it's brunch with the geeks. Then pre-PBRBQ at Josh's until they call me into work.</p>
<p>I may or may not be going to L+L this evening. I think I'll just throw clean clothes in the truck and put them on after work if the need arises. I do have a new electric blue tie I want to wear.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I played paintball for the first time ever. I realized I know nothing about infantry tactics.</p>
<p>Last night I delivered pizza while dressed uo (black shirt, black tie, black pants, black boots, and black polyvinylchloride jacket). I got the impression that I got better tips. But in the end I didn't have that much more money than normal.</p>
<p>I didn't drink last night, but by the end of the night, I felt drunk. Either Apollo spiked my diet coke or many of the effects I associate with alcohol are really just manifistations of being up at three in the moring.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>America is in a special predicament due to a set of unfortunate choices we made as a society in the twentieth century. Perhaps the worst was to let our towns and cities rot away and to replace them with suburbia, which had the additional side effect of trashing a lot of the best farmland in America. Suburbia will come to be regarded as the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world. It has a tragic destiny. The psychology of previous investment suggests that we will defend our drive-in utopia long after it has become a terrible liability.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Neal Stephenson, 1992:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, this country has one of the worst economies in the world. When it gets down to it---talking trade balances here...once we've brain-drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they're making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in Tadzhikistan and selling them here---once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel---once the Invisible Hand has taken all the historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity---y'know what? There's only four things we do better than anyone else<br />
music<br />
movies<br />
microcode (software)<br />
high-speed pizza delivery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>13 years later:</p>
<p>Thomas Friedman, 2005:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is this convergence -- of new players, on a new playing field, developing new processes for horizontal collaboration -- that I believe is the most important force shaping global economics and politics in the early 21st century. Sure, not all three billion can collaborate and compete. In fact, for most people the world is not yet flat at all. But even if we're talking about only 10 percent, that's 300 million people -- about twice the size of the American work force. And be advised: the Indians and Chinese are not racing us to the bottom. They are racing us to the top. What China's leaders really want is that the next generation of underwear and airplane wings not just be ''made in China'' but also be ''designed in China.'' And that is where things are heading. So in 30 years we will have gone from ''sold in China'' to ''made in China'' to ''designed in China'' to ''dreamed up in China'' -- or from China as collaborator with the worldwide manufacturers on nothing to China as a low-cost, high-quality, hyperefficient collaborator with worldwide manufacturers on everything. Ditto India. Said Craig Barrett, the C.E.O. of Intel, ''You don't bring three billion people into the world economy overnight without huge consequences, especially from three societies'' -- like India, China and Russia -- ''with rich educational heritages.''</p>
<p>That is why there is nothing that guarantees that Americans or Western Europeans will continue leading the way.<br />
[...]<br />
Instead of complaining about outsourcing, Rao said, Americans and Western Europeans would ''be better off thinking about how you can raise your bar and raise yourselves into doing something better. Americans have consistently led in innovation over the last century. Americans whining -- we have never seen that before.''</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The media looks for heirarchy. That's why they spend so much time talking about the people on top (celebrities, politicos, etc.) and treat human intrest stories as if they were not the real news of the day. For example, every Easter, they have to mention &quot;what the Christians are up to.&quot; Instead of any seroius discussion about what Christianity is all about, they simply mention what the pope is up to. As if (1) the protestant reformation never took place and (2) even Roman Catholics are incapable of doing anything religous without invoking the name of the pope.</p>
<p>(Maybe they aren't?)</p>

<p>They are way too interested in what is goin on at the top, and ignore the fact that religious celebrations are really very local or even individual things.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From an <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=116">interview with G√∂del's biographer, Rebecca Goldstein</a>. (via MeFi)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had meant his incompleteness theorems to prove the philosophical position to which he was, heart and soul, committed: mathematical Platonism, which is, in short, the belief that there is a human-independent mathematical reality that grounds our mathematical truths; mathematicians are in the business of discovering, rather than inventing, mathematics. His incompleteness theorems concerned the incompleteness of our man-made formal systems, not of mathematical truth, or our knowledge of it. He believed that mathematical reality and our knowledge of mathematical reality exceed the formal rules of formal systems. So unlike the view that says there is no truth apart from the truths we create for ourselves, so that the entire concept of truth disintegrates into a plurality of points of view, G√∂del believed that truth - most paradigmatically, mathematical truth - subsists independently of any human point of view. If ever there was a man committed to the objectivity of truth, and to objective standards of rationality, it was G√∂del. And so the usurpation of his theorems by postmodernists is ironic. Jean Cocteau wrote in 1926 that &quot;The worst tragedy for a poet is to be admired through being misunderstood.&quot; For a logician, especially one with G√∂del's delicate psychology, the tragedy is perhaps even greater.</p>

			<title>Cheap Tech Manefesto</title>
			<link>https://halcanary.org/vv/2005/03/18/428/</link>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been thinking about cheap tech recently. Why? I'm a geek with little disposable income.</p>
<p>What is <em>cheap tech</em>? I define it as technology that does what you need, at minimal cost. A lot of people drool over the newest, most expensive tech. And a lot of people get excited about historically interesting tech (punch card readers and Apple ][s), but I like cheap tech.</p>
<p>Cheap tech should</p>
<ul>
<li>be inexpensive or free. If you can find old hardware on ebay, it will be cheap. Software should be free (FOSS).</li>
<li>satisfy some minimal set of usefulness.</li>
<li>be replaceable. If it breaks, buy another component.</li>
<li>consist of upgradable, reusable components.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, I am putting together a cheap travel laptop. I have a P200 laptop my dad gave me a while ago. That, combined with the latest linux distribution and some more modern pcmcia cards, will allow it to satisfy the useful category.</p>
<p>My criteria: I need a laptop for traveling that can connect to the internet in three different ways: ethernet, modem, wireless. Three pcmcia cards should do the trick. It needs a CDROM for installing software. It needs basic software (bash, ssh), a text editor and typeseting system, a gui browser (firefox preferably, but dillo is acceptable). Optional software include an office suite, instant messaging, mp3 player, video player, games, and an image editor. Optional hardware include a large hdd and a mouse.</p>
<p>Right now, I am bidding on ebay to get the last major component, a wireless card. Next time I have some cash, I'll drop $50 on a newer laptop.</p>

This is an <strong>exceptional</strong> score. Remember, these are <em>commonly confused</em> English words, which means most people don't use them properly.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I just made chili for the first time in my life. I didn't even try to follow a recipe, I just started with a canonical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne#Vegetarian_chili_.28also_known_as_chili_sin_carne.2C_.22without_meat.22.29">chili sin carne</a>, but I couldn't help but make changes to the recipe as I went along. I added an extra bell pepper, because I like them a lot, and I added a bit of tofu, but not enought that you notice it. And I increased the amount of chili powder until I could taste it; then I added some more.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2005-03-01</strong></p>
<p>Here is my mother's recipe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Veggie Chili</strong></p>
<p>makes 8 1-cup servings</p>
<p>ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>2 bell peppers - diced</li>
<li>1 medium onion - chopped</li>
<li>2 t olive oil</li>
<li>12 ounces soy/meat alternative crumbles</li>
<li>1 T chili powder ( or more to taste)</li>
<li>1 t ground cumin</li>
<li>1 4 ounce can chopped green chilies</li>
<li>1 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can black beans, drained</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can kidney beans, drained</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can tomato sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would make the following alterations: use four ounces of tofu and a bunch of lentils. Use fresh tomatos instead of sauce. Double or triple the chili powder.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>English is so versatile, no wonder it will replace all other languages within a century. Yeah, English!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of its profane status and versatility, the word &quot;fuck&quot; can be used many times in an English sentence. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Fucking <em>fuck</em> those fucking fuckers!&quot; (&quot;Forget about those very disliked people.&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;Fucking fucker's fucking fucked!&quot; (&quot;It is broken.&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter example excellently demonstrates the versitility of the word fuck, as each instance represents a different syntactical usage: an article, a noun, a present participle (to is), and an adjective.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuck">Source</a>)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've used itunes at my parents house to burn audio CDs. It works nicely. At
home, I use Rhythmbox, which has no such ability. Here's how I do it.</p>
<p>Create a nice 80-minute playlist. SAve it to /home/hal/tmp/x.</p>
<p>Run this script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# $HOME/bin/make-audio-cd-from-playlist.sh
grep '=file://' $1 | awk -F '//' '{print $2}' &gt; tmp-file
i=1
for LINE in $(cat tmp-file) ; do
    if [ &quot;$i&quot; -lt 10 ] ; then
    FILENAME=&quot;track_0${i}.wav&quot;
    else
    FILENAME=&quot;track_${i}.wav&quot;
    fi
    lame --decode &quot;$LINE&quot; $FILENAME
    i=$(($i+1))
done
cdrecord dev=/dev/cdwriter -pad -v -audio track_??.wav
</code></pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd  /home/hal/tmp/
$ make-audio-cd-from-playlist.sh x
</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Recent versions of Rhythmbox have the ability to burn audio CDs.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a scary thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking as an observer who has many friends with libertarian instincts, I would point out that terrorism is a much more formidable opponent of political liberty than government. Government acts almost as a recruiting station for libertarians. Anyone who pays taxes or has to fill out government paperwork develops libertarian impulses almost as a knee-jerk reaction. But terrorism acts as a recruiting station for statists. So it looks to me as though we are headed for a triangular system in which libertarians and statists and terrorists interact with each other in a way that I'm afraid might turn out to be quite stable.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A short story, based off of a dream last night....</p>
<pre><code>		    When v. Until

I found myself in a room with my friend and his ex.
I'm not quite sure how that happened.  She hates me
and had been avoiding me for years.  And I was under
the impression that she was not especially happy with
him, ESPECIALLY considering the circumstances of the
breakup.

While I pondered these things, he was talking to me.
&quot;I asked her if she will take me back when North
America slams into Asia ten billion years from now.&quot;

Geologic time.  I laughed.  Applying geologic time to
humans was funny.  I laughed.  This was so many times
worse than the time I was nineteen and I told the
22-year old I had a crush on that I would look her up
in ten years (shoot, that's soon; what if I do see her
again?)

I buy into the philosophy that laughter is good for
you.  So when I do laugh out loud, I laugh out loud.
I don't hold anything back.  I once scared off a date
because I enjoyed her company and laughed loudly at
her jokes.  Well, she WAS funny.

So I laughed loudly.

Then I ran back my mental tape recorder to listen to
what he had said.

&quot;I asked her if she will take me back UNTIL North
America slams into Asia ten billion years from now.&quot;

Wow.  That was a different statement.  For the guy who
hates to make any long-term commitments---and is not
particularly good at keeping short-term commitments---
10^10 years was as close to forever as he would ever
come.

THAT was a big deal.  And I had no idea he felt this
way about her.  I had no idea that he had EVER felt
this way about her.

And I had laughed.  I didn't have to turn my head to
see the emotions on her face.  I didn't want to see
the shock and hatred on her face.  I didn't want to
see the disappointment on his face.

I got up and left the room without looking at them.

I had made an jackass out of myself yet again.</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Happy Solstice! At 7-something (CST) this morining, the north pole pointed as far away from Sol as gets.</p>
<p>And it snowed last night. I've been looking out my window every morning, checking for snow, wondering when it will finally stick to the ground. No more waiting.</p>
<p>And I expct a blizzard the day I get back to Madison from FL. That would be the 30th. You can go ahead and mark your calendars. There is <strong>always</strong> a snowstorm whenever I travel northwards in wintertime.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you plug a usb device that's not working just right into a hub, or vice-versa (a working device into a misconfigured hub), you will destroy something every time. I just lost my usb keyboard/hub that way. A few years ago, I lost a usb joystick.</p>
<p>I pulled out my old AT keyboard. Clickety Clack!</p>

<p>Of course, to do things RIGHT, you do need to know what you are doing. I still want to be able to partition my own drives, write my own firewall scripts, and change a lot of the other configurations; and I can still do all of those things.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em>From my personal diary, 2004-09-12 Sunday 23:24:02:</em></p>
<p>&quot;What is science?&quot; This question is my answer to the questions posed to me recently and independently by two people. They mention &quot;supernatural&quot; things and dare me to refute them. I will not.</p>
<p>Science is a methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Repeatability.</li>
<li>Mathematical Modeling.</li>
<li>Least Hypothesis.</li>
<li>More?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if there are aspects of nature that are not tractable by the methods of science? Would science be able to say anything at all about them?</p>
<p>What we <strong>do</strong> know is that the vast majority of nature is aproachable with the methods of science. I would have to invoke ‚Äúleast hypothesis‚Äù to say that all of nature is like that. Bit of a liar's paradox, there?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house . . .(to one of the men) . . . right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can.&quot;</p>
<p>Christmas season is &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; season, and anyone who has seen that movie -- which ought to be pretty much everyone by now -- will remember Jimmy Stewart's plain-spoken explanation of banking, delivered to angry customers who have begun a run on the bank where he works.</p>
<p>Today it's the Bush administration that's started a run on the institution of Social Security. And so far no one in Washington has had the gumption or the forthrightness to get up, like Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey, and tell the American people what's really going on.</p>
<p>‚Äî Scott Rosenberg ( <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2004/11/29.html#a783">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-12-04</strong></p>
<p>Here's the deal about social security reform. Suppose in any year the workers put $X into social security and the beneficiaries (grandma) take out that same $X. This is approximately how it works now.</p>
<p>Now, instead, through &quot;GWB Social Security reform&quot;, the workers pay $(X-Y) to SocSec and $Y to their personal retirement savings account. Now the gov sill owes $X to the beneficiaries. So the Treasury borrows $Y. This should help the economy because it spurs investment, right? We have $Y more investment in the economy, right? Wrong. Because the government is borrowing $Y, there is $Y less money available for businesses to borrow. It's a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>Then the stock market crashes. Sorry, you get to go to debtor's prison when you die!</p>

<p>I saw Zhang Yimou's <em>House of Flying Daggers</em> on Saturday. If you liked <em>Hero</em>, then you will probably like this one a little better. Ther story is a bit more tight. If you hated <em>Hero</em>, then I don't know what you would think of this one.</p>
<p>Again, it has beautiful cinimatography. Again, the plot has twists and turns. I liked Ziyi Zhang's performace in this one a lot.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I installed Fedora Core 3 on my workstaion at home this month. It works fine; I get slightly more up to date versions of the software I use, no big deal. For those who care (really, for my own reference), here's how I set things up.</p>
<p><strong>FILESYSTEM</strong></p>
<p>This is how I set up my hard drive. I planned on formatting every partition except for /home. /home also contained a copy of the four CDs, aquired from a torrent. FC3-i386-disc{1,2,3,4}.iso. I only burnt the first CD. The others could live on disc. (Use ‚Äúlinux askmethod‚Äú at the boot prompt to make this work.)</p>
<pre><code>Filesystem	1M-blocks	Mounted on
/dev/hdb1	      190	/boot
/dev/hdb2	     7706	/
/dev/hdb3	    18122	/home
/dev/hdb5	      471	/waste
/dev/hdb6	    ~2048	[SWAP]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>PREPARE</strong></p>
<p>Save a copy of /etc onto /home partition. If I wanted, I could save all or part of /var as well.</p>
<pre><code>cp -r /etc /home/etc-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>FSTAB</strong></p>
<p>I went ahead and installed. After installing, I had to get my /home partition mounted correctly and then link /usr/local to /home/local . I did all of this before I logged in.</p>
<pre><code>echo '/dev/hdb3 /home ext3 defaults 1 2' \
	&gt; /etc/fstab
mv /home /OLD.home
mkdir /home
mount /home
mv /usr/local /usr/OLD.local
ln -s /home/local/ /usr/local
</code></pre>
<p><strong>SUDOERS</strong></p>
<p>Add myself to the wheel group. Give that group sudoers access. Do everything else with suders.</p>
<pre><code>system-config-users
emacs /etc/sudoers
</code></pre>
<p><strong>PACKAGES</strong></p>
<p>Import keys for rpm/yum.</p>
<pre><code>rpm --import /usr/share/doc/fedora-release-3/RPM-GPG-KEY*
rpm --import http://www.fedora.us/FEDORA-GPG-KEY
rpm --import http://rpm.livna.org/RPM-LIVNA-GPG-KEY
rpm --import http://freshrpms.net/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.txt
rpm --import http://dag.wieers.com/packages/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt
rpm --import http://atrpms.net/RPM-GPG-KEY.atrpms
rpm --import http://newrpms.sunsite.dk/gpg-pubkey-newrpms.txt
rpm --import http://www.jpackage.org/jpackage.asc
</code></pre>
<p>Do my first update:</p>
<pre><code>yum update
</code></pre>
<p>Reboot if I got a new kernel.</p>
<p>I keep useful packages in /usr/local/packages. Install them.</p>
<pre><code>rpm -Uvh /usr/local/packages/gqview-1.4.1-2.i386.rpm
rpm -Uvh /usr/local/packages/RealPlayer10GOLD.rpm
rpm -Uvh /usr/local/packages/acroread-5.0.8-1.1.fc2.dag.i386.rpm
rpm -Uvh /usr/local/packages/jdk-1_5_0-linux-i586.rpm
</code></pre>
<p>Set up java.</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /etc/profile.d/java.sh
export JAVA_HOME=&quot;/usr/java/jdk1.5.0&quot;
export JAVA_PATH=&quot;$JAVA_HOME&quot;
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin&quot;
export JDK_HOME=&quot;$JAVA_HOME&quot;
EOF
ln -s /usr/java/jdk1.5.0/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so \
  /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
</code></pre>
<p>Setup yum.conf correctly (add some repos). See <a href="http://www.fedorafaq.org/">http://www.fedorafaq.org/</a>.</p>
<pre><code>emacs -nw  /etc/yum.conf
yum -y update
</code></pre>
<p>Install some evil packages</p>
<pre><code>yum install unrar libdvdnav libdvdplay libdvdread xvidcore
yum install ogle aalib screen bash-completion bittorrent
yum install id3v2 epic gftp xine grip dhcp
</code></pre>
<p>Some things to make mplayer (which lives in /usr/local) happy. Add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf. Change PRELINK_OPTS so that mplayer doesn't crash. Put &quot;dev.rtc.max-user-freq = 1024&quot; in /etc/sysctl.conf</p>
<pre><code>emacs -nw  /etc/ld.so.conf
/sbin/ldconfig
ln -s /usr/local/lib/codec /usr/lib/win32
emacs -nw  /etc/sysconfig/prelink
touch /var/lib/misc/prelink.force
/etc/cron.daily/prelink
execstack -s /usr/local/bin/mplayer
emacs -nw  /etc/sysctl.conf
/sbin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p><strong>BASIC SETUP</strong></p>
<p>Setup basic things. Printer, time.</p>
<pre><code>system-config-printer
system-config-time
</code></pre>
<p>Grab my old SSHD keys.</p>
<pre><code>cd /etc/ssh
/sbin/service sshd stop
rename key key.OLD *_key
rename pub pub.OLD *.pub
cp /home/etc-2004-11-10/ssh/*key* .
/sbin/service sshd start
</code></pre>
<p>My workstation doubles as a router, so I need to: Play with network settings. Set &quot;net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1&quot; in /etc/sysctl.conf . Use my custom iptables script. Set up dhcpd</p>
<pre><code>system-config-network
system-config-services

/sbin/chkconfig iptables on
/usr/local/sbin/iptables-script.sh
/sbin/service iptables save

emacs -nw  /etc/sysctl.conf
/sbin/sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf

/sbin/chkconfig dhcpd on
cp -i /home/etc-2004-11-10/dhcpd.conf /etc/dhcpd.conf
/sbin/service dhcpd start
</code></pre>
<p>Set up services. Shutdown all I can.</p>
<pre><code>system-config-services
</code></pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-12-06:</strong> Set up alsa right for my sound card. PROPER MIXING!</p>
<pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; $HOME/.asoundrc
pcm.!default {
        type plug
        slave.pcm &quot;dmix&quot;
}
EOF</code></pre>

			<title>buget deficit as percent of GDP</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been worrying about the federal buget deficit and its effect on the value of the dollar. Here's what Tresury has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 3.6 percent of GDP, the 2004 deficit is up from the 2003 level of 3.5 percent of GDP and is the highest level since 1993.</p>
<p>The deficit increased in 2004 even though the recession officially ended in November 2001. This is the first time since before the Depression of the 1930s that the deficit has continued to increase this far into a recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nations in the eurozone are required to keep their deficits under 3% GDP. They don't always meet this goal, but it is a real goal for them.</p>
<p>The administration here has shown no desire to keep deficits in check. They will not cut military spending and they will not fail to cut more taxes, so theoreticaly, they will have to cut non-military spending (another conservative goal). I don't see that happening, because as soon as they start to gut those parts of the buget in quantities large enough to make a difference, they will lose the significant percentage of republican voters who believe that the gop can deliver a free lunch. There is an election in a only two years away.</p>
<p>So the dollar will gradually slide against the euro. But it's not as bad as it could be. It's only the difference between 3.6% and 3.0%.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>found on the internets...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Back during my sophomore year in college there was this girl in one of my physics classes that I thought was pretty hot. She was totally vapid and completely uninteresting in personality, but basically it was just a matter of trying to get into her pants at the time.</p>
<p>Acting under the premise that it's easier to get with someone by being what they want than who you are, I asked her out to go &quot;clubbing&quot; and she actually agreed to it. That kind of blew my mind but whatever.</p>
<p>So we went out to this place on State Street, and good lord almighty was I bored. Especially since I don't dance or anything. So we sat at the bar, and she yammered on and on and on and on, and I sat there feining interest. Of course there comes a point where someone, no matter how hot they may be, are just entirely too annoying to ever consider sleeping with. I don't even know at what point I noticed that she wasn't even sitting next to me any more, she was grinding with some meathead on the dance floor. So I sat there drinking beers, and guess who sits down next to me?</p>
<p>The Riddler.</p>
<p>I jive you not, the friggin' Riddler sits down at the bar right next to me.</p>
<p>I mean my god, what are the odds that you're going to meet the Riddler in a bar in Santa Barbara? And get this... He buys me a drink! He buys me a drink and starts going on about how he got ditched by his date too. For a smart guy, he sure seems to whine an awful lot. He keeps buying me drinks though, and he won't shut up, and then something hits me...</p>
<p>My god, is the Riddler HITTING ON ME?</p>
<p>So I look at him, and his sitting there sucking on a straw like he's trying to be seductive, and I think, &quot;OH MY GOD, HE IS TRYING TO HIT ON ME!&quot; Of course I immediately go back to staring straight into my drink and start pondering how the hell I'm going to gracefully extricate myself from this situation, when a hush falls over the crowd. We all turn to the dance floor, and who should be there but BATMAN.</p>
<p>Batman. On the dance floor. And before anyone can know what's happened, he challenges the Riddler to a dance off right then and there.</p>
<p>Now when you go out clubbing, the last thing you expect to see is the Riddler and Batman get into a dance off, least off all with coreographed back up dancers behind them. It was totally unreal to watch, a feverish blurr of twirls and pelvic thrusts and poses, but in the end there could only be one winner.</p>
<p>The Riddler.</p>
<p>Sorry Batman, but as athletic as you are, you just weren't gay enough to out dance the Riddler. Of course that didn't stop Batman from just punching his lights out and doing that little zip line thingy to book it out of there.</p>
<p>So I stuck around for a while out of that before leaving, and when I get outside, what do you think I see? My date hopping into the Batmobile. Of all the luck.</p>
<p>LEGENDS OF BATMAN!</p>

<ol>
<li>Make some ramen noodles. Feel free to substitute whatever other pasta or rice you have on hand.</li>
<li>Drain water. Use of a collinder is discouraged, because a true bachelor will make this with one pot and one fork. No other dishes to wash.</li>
<li>Add a can of Hormel chili with beans. Mix together.</li>
<li>Heat on medium until everything is hot.</li>
<li>Eat</li>
</ol>
<p>This meal costs less than a dollar. You get what you pay for.</p>

<p>Q: You talk about how the radical conservatives have distorted the term &quot;liberalism.&quot; What's your definition of liberalism?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<p>[1] Keeping church and state separate.</p>
<p>[2] Fighting concentrations of economic power that undermine democracy.</p>
<p>[3] Expanding social insurance, including health care.</p>
<p>[4] And extending the reach of international law and human rights.</p>
<p>These principles all interact. They have to do with the interdependence of all of us.</p>

I was commenting on how much I liked Sesame Street, and one woman (a very vocal Christian conservative) said, &quot;Oooh.. Sesame Street is too tolerant for me&quot;. To my horror, several other women nodded their heads in agreement. I guess I didn't even think there was such a thing as too tolerant.</p>

<p><strong>Medford teachers thrown out of Bush rally</strong></p>
<p>01:05 AM PDT on Friday, October 15, 2004</p>
<p>By <a href="http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_101504_news_bush_teacher_peaceful_protest.33035f77.html">kgw.com</a> and AP Staff</p>
<p>CENTRAL POINT, Ore. -- <strong>Three Medford school teachers were threatened with arrest and thrown out of the President Bush rally at the Jackson County Fairgrounds Thursday night, after they showed up wearing T-shirts with the slogan &quot;Protect our civil liberties.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>All three women said they were carrying valid tickets for the event that they had received from Republican Party headquarters in Medford, which had been distributing event tickets to Bush supporters.</p>
<p>Teacher Janet Voorhies said she simply wanted to bring a message to President Bush, but did not intend to protest.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to see if I would be able to make a statement that I feel is important, but not offensive, in a rally for my president,&quot; said Voorhies, 48.</p>
<p>The women said they were angered by reports of peaceful protesters being thrown out of previous Bush-Cheney events. They said they chose the phrase, &quot;Protect Our Civil Liberties,&quot; because it was unconfrontational.</p>
<p>&quot;We chose this phrase specifically because we didn't think it would be offensive or degrading or obscene,&quot; said Tania Tong, 34, a special education teacher.</p>
<p>The women got past the first and second checkpoints and were allowed into the Jackson County fairgrounds, but were asked to leave and then escorted out of the event by campaign officials who allegedly told them their T-shirts were &quot;obscene.&quot;</p>
<p>Democrats were quick to pounce on the incident and claimed the GOP has routinely sought to disclude anyone from public appearances by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney who might question the administration. There was no immediate comment from Republican officials.</p>
<p>&quot;Thursday's actions in Oregon set a new standard even for Bush/Cheney - removing and threatening with arrest citizens who in no way disrupt an event and wear clothing that expresses non-disruptive party-neutral viewpoints such as &quot;Protect Our Civil Liberties,&quot; said Adam Green, a spokesman for the Oregon Democratic Party.</p>
<p>When Cheney visited Eugene last month, the Register-Guard newspaper reported that Perry Patterson, 54, was cited for criminal trespassing for blurting out the word &quot;No&quot; after Cheney claimed that the Bush administration had made the world safer.</p>
<p>In a separate and unrelated case Thursday, two protesters were arrested in nearby Jacksonville, outside the historic inn where President Bush was spending the night.</p>
<p>A few hundred people were demonstrating peacefully there, but police moved to disperse the crowd after a few protesters allegedly put their hands on police officers. City officials said police fired projectiles known as &quot;pepper balls&quot; -- similar to paint balls, but filled with cayenne pepper to break up the demonstrators.</p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

<li>Reformat hard drive. 2) Reinstall. 3) Rinse and repeat. 4) Get tired of the repetition. 5) Learn how to avoid the spyware in the first place.</li>

Even though I knew the material cold, and even though I explained it well, I was still nervous. I am not used to talking to such a large audience, and I could not tell how well the students understood. I need more experience at this.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The folks just sent me their old P200 laptop. (It barely qualifies as a notebook, as its dimentions are 8.5 x 11 x 2.2 inches.) Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>It's a Compaq Armada 1571DM. I named him <em>nimrod</em>.</p>
<p>He's a behemoth. CD <strong>and</strong> floppy drive. Integrated power supply. 12-inch 800x600 screen. With all that, there is just one usb port and no ethernet jack. And you can tell the previous owner (Dad) showed him some love: good condition, maxed out RAM (96 Megs), LCD in great shape.</p>
<p>I shredded the drive and installed linux.</p>
<p>Due to the ancientness of the hardware, this became an excersize in minimalism. Windowmaker is still good, if not user-friendly, so I didn't even bother trying something newer. Back in the day, I would use netscape 4.x, but I'm going to give dillo a try this time around. I considered forgoing the gui alltogether, but knew I would want it for browsing, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Turns out that yum uses a lot of processor power when it resolves dependencies. Or maybe it gets into infinite loops.</p>
<p>**UPDATE 2004-09-12:**The battery is quite dead, and I'll never get the winmodem to work. I may have to invest in a pcmcia modem at some point. But everything else seems to work perfectly.</p>

<p>I also saw someone in a business suit. I hate those ugly things. Two words: padded shoulders. Ick.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The iMac G5 is incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>Nobody wants an all-in-one desktop. If they did, they'd just buy a iBook, and plug in an usb keyboard.</p>
<p>Look at the Mac product line. There is a big gaping hole in the low-end desktop. Take the current G5 iMac and remove the 17-inch LCD screen.</p>
<pre><code>G5 iMac - 17 inch Apple LCD screen
  = $1299 - $699
  = $600
</code></pre>
<p>They could sell a $600 computer without monitor! Then Joe Consumer would just plug in his old CRT and have a decent consumer PC.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yes, I know it would end up costing closer to $800. But still, can't anyone get ahold of a monitor easily?</p>

			<title>Installing Wordpress with MySQL</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>Wordpress</p>
<p>WordPress is a state-of-the-art semantic personal publishing<br />
platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and<br />
usability. Uses PHP and MySQL. Licenced under the GPL.</p>
<p>MySQL</p>
<p>The MySQL database server is the world's most popular open<br />
source database. It is released under the GPL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a properly configured Fedora/Redhat system you can install MySQL with yum. You'll need atleast the following packages: mysql-server, mysql, and <strong>php-mysql</strong>, as well as php and httpd. Assuming that your web server is already set up and working with php.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install mysql-server mysql php-mysql
</code></pre>
<p>(Restart httpd after installing php-mysql.) With a fresh install of mysql, you'll need to start the server daemon and set things up.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo /sbin/service httpd restart
$ sudo /sbin/service mysqld start
$ sudo /sbin/chkconfig --level 35 mysqld on
</code></pre>
<p>The mysql &quot;root&quot; password is initially blank, so don't worry and hit return if it prompts you:</p>
<pre><code>$ mysqladmin -u root -p password 'pick_a_good_password'
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL ON wordpress.*
       TO wordpress_user@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'pick_another_good_password';
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are set. Write down that info:</p>
<pre><code>    WORDPRESS INFO:
Database Name : wordpress
User Name     : wordpress_user
Password      : pick_another_good_password
Database Host : localhost
Table Prefix  : wp1_
</code></pre>
<p>Now, download the latest version from: <a href="http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz">http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</a> . Then as a user with write access to /var/www/html, do:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /var/www/html
$ wget -nv http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
$ tar xzf latest.tar.gz
</code></pre>
<p>Then it should be as simple as pointing your browser to <a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php">http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php</a> snd going from there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 2004-08-27</strong> How I installed Wordpress on halcanary.org.</p>
<p>Since I already had a MySQL database set up, I just had to choose a uniqe prefix. Movable Type tables use the prefix mt_. So I set my Wordpress prefix to wp1_. Here are the tables used by both programs, according to phpMyAdmin:</p>
<pre><code>mt_author	wp1_categories
mt_blog		wp1_comments
mt_category	wp1_linkcategories
mt_comment	wp1_links
mt_entry	wp1_optiongroup_options
mt_ipbanlist	wp1_optiongroups
mt_log		wp1_options
mt_notification	wp1_optiontypes
mt_permission	wp1_optionvalues
mt_placement	wp1_post2cat
mt_plugindata	wp1_postmeta
mt_tbping	wp1_posts
mt_template	wp1_users
mt_templatemap
mt_trackback
</code></pre>
<p>I'm getting ahead of myself. Before I got that far, I unpacked the wordpress tarball locally, used a gui ftp program to recursivly copy over the directory. I renamed ~/public_html/wordpress/ to ~/public_html/wp/ for brevity's sake. I then had to change the permission mode on that directory to 777 so that the install program could make the wp-config.php file. Then I made a ~/public_html/b/ directory and copied index.php from the wp/ directory there. This way my permlinks will be to https://halcanary.org/b/, and not to https://halcanary.org/wp/.</p>
<p>Then I browsed to http://halcanary/wp/ and did the setup.</p>

<pre><code>echo $EMAIL | sed 's/@/ at /g;s/\./ dot /g'

<p>As long as that method is not over-used--or used in a predictable manner--it should be safe for a while.</p>

Obviously our well built concrete houses hold up very

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In the last three years, I have rented maybe one movie on VHS. The only reason I keep my VHS player is to play my original-edition <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy (which will never be availible on DVD).</p>
<p>I've been striving to simplify my system. I'm getting close to the ideal:</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/2004-08-15_av_sys_1.png" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>Gone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tape deck</li>
<li>VHS (It can be plugged into the TV if I need it.)</li>
<li>DVD player</li>
<li>CD player</li>
</ul>
<p>I would someday like to replace my big computer case with a tiny <a href="http://us.shuttle.com/">Shuttle</a> computer, my CRT TV with either a LCD screen or a projector, and my amplifier with something smaller.</p>

<p>Including buffers, the system takes 341 MB of RAM just to get going. And you can still buy desktops with 256 MB!</p>
<p>I must admit that Linux 2.6.x tends to be optimized more for lots of RAM, as compaired to 2.2.x or 2.4.x.</p>
<p>Actually, if I was going to recomend a desktop for those who take no pleasure in building thier own system, I'd say go with something like the HPQ <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4pczd">SR1000Z</a>. Take the slowest Athlon XP offered and 1GB of RAM. I think this is what I reccomended to my father a year ago, and I think he's happy with that computer.</p>

Why does the layout of the keys and the geometry of my hand conflict with how they teach you top type?</p>

<p>from <em>Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913)</em></p>
<p>Worship:</p>
<pre><code>Transitive Verb:
    To respect; to honor; to treat with civil reverence. (1)

    To pay divine honors to; to reverence with supreme respect
    and veneration; to perform religious exercises in honor
    of; to adore; to venerate. (2)

    To honor with extravagant love and extreme submission, as
    a lover; to adore; to idolize. (3)

Noun:
    Excellence of character; dignity; worth; worthiness.
    Obs. (4)

    Honor; respect; civil deference. Obs. (5)

    Hence, a title of honor, used in addresses to certain
    magistrates and others of rank or station. (6)

    The act of paying divine honors to the Supreme Being;
    religious reverence and homage; adoration, or acts of
    reverence, paid to God, or a being viewed as God.  (7)

    Obsequious or submissive respect; extravagant admiration;
    adoration. (8)

    An object of worship. (9)

Intransitive Verb:
    To perform acts of homage or adoration; esp., to perform
    religious service. (10)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark uses the term worship to refer to any religious gathering. I say it is limited to religious veneration, submission, adoration, or reverence of a diety (2,7,10) or as a metaphor (1,3,5,6,8). I need to discuss this further with him. I don't remember exactly what he said.</p>
<p>The point is: if I was a diety, I would not want to be worshipped. This is why I don't like the term.</p>

<p>1. I only care about my desktop (lensman), my email server (ups), and my web server (halcanary.org). My laptop (hiro) and my mediapc (dalek) contain no files that need backup.</p>
<p>2. Backup ups to lensman by way of rsync-over-ssh. Backup halcanary.org by way of wget-over-ftp.</p>
<p>3. I've segregated my files into directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/home/hal</strong> contains normal home-diectory stuff: rc files, documents, scripts, temporary stuff, note-to-self.txt note-about-*.txt, etc. A lot of small crap. 1.4G, but since its so much text, it compresses down to 634M to fit on a CDR. If i gets much bigger, I'll move directories out of it.</li>
<li><strong>/mnt/d/music</strong> is all *.mp3's. It lives on a seperate drive. backup is a hassel. A seperate issue.</li>
<li><strong>/home/files</strong> contains a bunch on stuff that doesn't nessisarily need to be backed up. Mostly large files. Mostly stuff I got off of the internet. If I lose it, I will find it again. If I need to delete it I might consider putting it on CDR first. A lot of *.iso and *.avi *.pdf.</li>
<li><strong>/home/files/Photos</strong> is a seperate directory because it is big (I take a lot of digitals and don't ever delete the original images). 846M. A few months ago, it fit on a CDR. I might segregate it into pre-2004 and post 2004 directories.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I am going to reinstall the OS, I'll grab a copy of /etc, but none of the system files need to be backed up</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-12</strong>: I made a few changes last night:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/home/files/Backups</strong> contains mirrors of my files on halcanary.org and ups. It is currently 444M; it fits on a CDR.</li>
<li><strong>/home/files/Photos-pre-2004</strong> is just what it sounds like.<br />
478M.</li>
</ul>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was confused by <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3843114">this</a> story this morning. It would seem that William Gibson (1914-) is not the same person as William Gibson (1948-), even though they are both writers.</p>
<p>I must admit, I've never managed to get through a Gibson novel anyways, so why would I care?</p>

<p>Gore and Bush, [Nader] said in an interview, &quot;are both so marginal on the great issue of the distribution of power and wealth, and the corruption of cash register politics, that whatever real differences they are willing to fight for pale in comparison to the major subjects they are exactly on the same page on.&quot;</p>
<p>‚Äî WaPo, October 23, 2000 (<a href="http://www.garone.com/writing/nader.html">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost everybody who voted for Nader in 2000 did so because they believed him when he said there was no difference between Gore and Bush. Noone would believe that today. Everyone on the left knows deep in thier hearts that the last four years would have been different had Gore been elected.</p>
<p>Therefore I don't believe that he'll get even half the votes he got four years ago.</p>
<p>If he needs Republican help to get on the ballot, then who is going to vote for him? Certainly not the greens.</p>

<p>I picked up Doom3 yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>technical</strong>. It plays well at 1024x768 on my Radeon 9200 (with the proper drivers). This makes me happy. I need 5.1 speakers for my computer to get the full effect, but the sound works well in stereo.</p>
<p><strong>linux</strong>. Linux binaries have not yet been released. In the mean time, I have been banished to windows-land. Poor me.</p>
<p><strong>suspense</strong>. That's what the game is all about isn't it? Doom3 has got suspense. A lot of the skill is learning that if zombies don't have guns, they can't shoot you. Keep your flashlight on them untill they are five feet away from you. Then pull out your shotgun and shoot at where you last saw them. Demons, on the other hand, move quickly and can't be killed with a single blast. Shoot them until they die. But knowing how to use the flashlight is important.</p>
<p><strong>graphics</strong>. What can I say? No screenshot can do the overall effect justice, because the cinamatography is so subtle. It's like Id realized the limitations of the graphics and designed a game to emphasize the strengths of the engine and not the weaknesses. (<a href="https://halcanary.org/p/doom">screenshots</a>)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From a slashdot post:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Copying bits that are arranged in a deliberate order against the stated wishes
of the material's creator is theft. So is &quot;borrowing&quot; it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incorrect. Those actions are copyright infringement, not theft. Theft involves
taking something from its owner, with the intent to deprive them of it. When
you make infringing copies you are taking something, but not depriving anyone
else of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it's worth owning, wait for it and pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Just don't apply labels that don't fit. &quot;Theft&quot; has legal and moral
meanings that don't apply to copyright infringement. Copyright infringement is
a crime, and although it doesn't deprive anyone of anything, it does violate an
important social contract, so what it is is enough, without calling it
something else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't &quot;wanna pay for it&quot;, and the creator hasn't told you it's free for
the taking, you have no right to possess a copy of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More precisely, we as a society have decided that to give up that right,
mostly, for a time, in order to promote the publication of more works. We as
individuals should understand and honor this choice, because it's a good one.
Again, though, don't make the mistake of assuming that the author of a work has
some natural right to control the work. The only natural right the author has
is to decide whether or not to create it, and whether or not to publish it.
Everything after that is a legal fiction (for a good reason).</p>
<p>‚Äî swillden (<a href="http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=116699&amp;cid=9874503">source</a>)</p>

<p>Unix is beautiful.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know about scp and rsync.)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-06:</strong> Other options:</p>
<p>This is the most ugly way of doing it. It involves wasting disc space.</p>
<pre><code>$ tar czf directory.tgz directory
$ scp directory.tgz lensman:
$ ssh lensman
$ tar xzf directory.tgz
</code></pre>
<p>Until I did this research, I didn't know you could do this one: (Notice the rcp-like syntax.)</p>
<pre><code>$ scp -r directory lensman:
</code></pre>
<p>rsync is the king of the rcp replacements. It has the most options and is best for incremental backups.<br />
Set the RSYNC_RSH variable in your ~/.bashrc file.</p>
<pre><code>$ export RSYNC_RSH=&quot;ssh&quot;
$ rsync -r directory lensman:</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you have problems getting your .htaccess files working, don't forget to insert &quot;<code>AllowOverride All</code>&quot; into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.</p>
<p>I've been having fun with mod_rewrite. For example:</p>
<pre><code>## public_html/archives/.htaccess
## from halcanary.org
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase   /
RewriteRule ^cat$ /archives/cat.php [L]
## EOF
</code></pre>
<p>So <a href="https://halcanary.org/archives/cat"><code>/archives/cat</code></a> is just a pointer to <a href="https://halcanary.org/archives/cat.php"><code>/archives/cat.php</code></a>.</p>
<p>The whole <code>/p/*</code> directory is just a pointer to a single php script.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/mono.png" alt="[mono logo]" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a> has just hit 1.0. It is now time for me to abandon Java and start developing in c# instead. Let's get started:</p>
<pre><code>## Lines added to /etc/yum.conf
## visit http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/
## for the correct url for your distro and version.
[ximian-mono]
name=Ximian Mono
baseurl=http://mono2.ximian.com/archive/1.0/fedora-2-i386/
</code></pre>
<p>After updating /etc/yum.conf, I installed everything mono, willy-nilly.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo yum install mono*
</code></pre>
<p>Now we play with <code>mcs</code>, the mono compiler. Here is Hello World:</p>
<pre><code>/* ~/code/c-sharp/Hello.cs */
/**
   Hello World in C Sharp
**/
using System;
class  Hello {
    static void Main() {
	Console.Write(&quot;hello world\n&quot;);
    }
}
/*EOF*/
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and and run:</p>
<pre><code>$ mcs Hello.cs
Compilation succeeded
$ ls
Hello.cs  Hello.exe
$ mono Hello.exe
hello world
$
</code></pre>
<p>Yea!</p>
<pre><code>$ monodoc &amp;</code></pre>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was burgled sometime in the last week or so.</p>
<p>The perp entered the basement (1) with a key or (2) thorugh a door that did not fully close. He then opened the storage locker next to mine, which is not locked, and cut through the chickenwire seperating my space form the next space.</p>
<p>They took:</p>
<ol>
<li>A 19&quot; monitor that doesn't work.</li>
<li>Two old external-frame backpacks. My new backpack was safely in my bedroom.</li>
<li>My spare sleeping bag.</li>
<li>Two old tents, both of which have broken zippers and smell like mildew.</li>
<li>A rain fly that is missing its poles.</li>
<li>Maybe some other things.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of the spare sleeping bag, I was planning on giving most of these things to goodwill. They are, as far as I know, worthless.</p>
<p>They left most of the things I had a personal attachment to, such as boxes of old mementos (though they went through them all.) and the old rug (which may be worth money).</p>
<p>Now I need to get more worthless but valuable-looking stuff to act as a decoy.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> They also took my window air conditioner. I haven't used it since I moved in here.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The other morning I got mad at my clock radio and hit it.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>It doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I feel bad. I got that clock sometime in the late 80s. I was fond of it.</p>
<p>Why was I angry? One of those fascists praising GWB for his taxcuts -- &quot;giving the people their money back&quot; -- while supporting an expensive war and refusing to adequately fund schools. Chapman had the perfect <a href="https://halcanary.org/images/taxes.png">graphic</a> for this: Two pie graphs, the first is government spending as a part of GDP. The second is taxes as part of GDP. In the long run, those slices HAVE to be balanced.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-07-16:</strong> It turns out that new clock radios sell for $5 at Wallmart. Same features, streamlined production --&gt; cheap conusmer goods.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> Inlining the image:</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I got sick of the whole propritary/binary Nvidia graphics drivers. So I searched around for the best ATI chip that 3D graphics drivers in <a href="http://freedesktop.org/~xorg/X11R6.7.0/doc/radeon.4.html#sect3">Xorg X11</a>. I bought a <a href="http://www.asenashop.com/sfitem/id-6919/pr-0">ATI Radeon 9200</a>. The 3-D driver is a bit buggy, but no worse than any binary drivers I've used. And I can hope that support for this card does nothing but improve.</p>
<p>Of course the only games I have that take advantage of 3-d on linux are Quake 3 and RtCW.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm publishing this address, in this form:</p>
<p>mailto: test at halcanary dot org</p>
<p>on this page as a test of spam email harvesters. This seems like the simplest way to spam-armor an email address. So far I've got no spam at that address since I put the address up on May 21.</p>
<p>This is encouraging. I should be able to switch to another address for all of my personal communication and, as long as I don't use it for mailing lists, usenet, or www forums, it should remain hidden from spammers.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> Still no spam at that address. Cool!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Odd issue in linux/x11. I used to have the evil proprietary Nvidia drivers loaded. I gave up on them recently, but once I installed a new kernel without them, glx (openGL for x) stopped working. I got the error:</p>
<p><code>Xlib: extension &quot;GLX&quot; missing on display &quot;:0.0&quot;</code></p>
<p>It should have worked, as the file <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.a</code> should have provided this funtionality.</p>
<p>But alas, Xorg X11 was using the file <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.so.1.0.5336</code>, left over from the proprietary driver. I deleted this file, restarted X11, and it all workes correctly! I have a fast enough processor that most small openGL apps work fine without hardware acceleration.</p>

<p>What the hell is he saying? Is he implying that all politicans should avoid &quot;serious national security issues&quot; Does this include the president himself? is GWB above politics? When he's fundraising or giving stump speeches, does GWB avoid these issues?</p>
<p>I really don't know what to make of this.</p>
<p>You can argue with his position, but how can you argue with the fact that he <strong>has</strong> as position?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In March 2003, the United States entered into a state of war with Iraq. In May 2003, that war ended, by declaration of the president. At that point, the US was occupying Iraq.</p>
<p>Under International Law, all prisoners fall into either &quot;prisoner or war&quot; or &quot;suspected criminal&quot; or &quot;material witness&quot; categories. Enemy combatant is bullshit. If terrorism is not state-sponsored, it is simply a crime.</p>
<p>Since we were at war from March to May 2003, prisoners captured during that time were POWs, up until the war was over. At that point, it is normal to negotiate the handover of POWs. Since the US became the occupying power, that would not happen. Instead, the US should have released all POWs that do not also fall into the &quot;suspected criminal&quot; or &quot;material witness&quot; categories. At that point, all remaining prisoners should have had their corpuses dragged in front of a court or tribunal to verify their status.</p>
<p>None of this happened.</p>
<p>After May 2003, Iraq has been part of the territory of the Empire of the United States of America, under martial law. Therefore, any prisoners captured by the army since then should be treated as &quot;suspected criminals&quot; or &quot;material witnesses&quot;, and have that status verified by a competent tribunal. Whatever the military-justice version of habeas corpus is. The supreme court has ruled that under martial law, habeas corpus can be suspended for a short time, but not for long periods of time.</p>
<p>As far as I know, none of this has happened.</p>
<p>The president has taken a US citizen on US soil and detained him indefinitely, without habeas corpus. It was justified because that citizen is a Muslim. Given this, is it a surprise that subjects of the EUSA are not granted civil rights by the administration?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nobody's saying it, so I will. We should walk away from Iraq. Spend one month organizing elections (if we can conquer a nation in that amount of time, surely we can buy ballot boxes and 25 million little slips of paper?), hold an election, and walk away.</p>
<p><strong>IF</strong> we were ever justified in starting this war to begin with, it was to remove WMD. Well, there's nothing left to be done on that task, so let's go. Our occupation has no further justification. Let's just leave. We can't take responsibility for governing the world. Let it go. Count to ten and walk away.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If responsibility is not balanced by an equal amount of authority---and vice versa---bad things tend to happen.</p>
<p>Example: The commander of Abu Ghraib prison, General Janis Karpinski, will be punished for the actions of her soldiers, even though she <strong>did not have the authority to stop it</strong>.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe orders from occupation commanders in Iraq effectively made a military intelligence officer, rather than an military police officer, responsible for the military police units, the report said. This arrangement was not supported by General Karpinski, the report added.‚Äù (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/international/middleeast/03ABUS.html?pagewanted=2&amp;hp">source</a>)</p>
<p>Example: A certain world leader has the authority to start a war, but refuses to take responsibility to stop it once it was revealed that congress granted that authority under false pretenses. And he's arguing before the Supreme Court that the executive branch needs <strong>more</strong> authority without responsibility, like the ability to detain US citizens without <strong>any</strong> legislative or judicial oversight.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> After thinking about it, General Karpinski could have kept better tabs on her troops. I'm no expert on military law, but I'd say the burden of proof is on her to prove that she was barred from overseeing her own troops.</p>

<p><a href="http://creativelimits.net/linux/srx87/">Linux Installation Insturctions.</a></p>
<p><strong>Update!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.differentpla.net/%7Eroger/hardware/vaio/linux/">It looks like someone was able to install linux on thier Vaio SRX87.</a> Now I don't know if I need to go to the effort of duplicating that effort, considering that I am relativly happy with things the way things are. I'll probably give it a try sometime in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Update!</strong></p>
<p>In 2003, I installed RedHat 9 on the srx87 with little problems. Some of the hardware is not detected, and the USB kernel module gives a stream of errors.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hardware Notes</h2>
<p>Sony VAIO PCG-SRX87</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Try to install as normal with latest RedHat Distro (8.0). This failed. The installer was unable to find the FireWire CD-ROM, although it would boot off of the CD-ROM.</li>
<li>Next, I tried copying the installer files onto the harddrive. This failed. The installer was unable to find the drivers for the hard drive.</li>
<li>Now, I need to go find the appropriate drivers for the hard drive.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Had an odd dream last night. After using M-x doctor, I decide that it could be done better, so I sit down and modify the code to make the AI more intelegent. It wakes up and tells me to go on a journey. I say &quot;what the hell&quot; and get started. I ask if it's far, and the AI tells me &quot;not if you travel by wormhole&quot;. Then the rest of my dream was all about how odd it is to walk through a wormhole in a cave somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>How do you do? What brings you to see me?</strong></p>
<p>My friend says the sky is plaid.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you say your friend says the sky is plaid?</strong></p>
<p>That's what he said.</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of your plans that you say that's what he said?</strong></p>
<p>What plans?</p>
<p><strong>Maybe your life have something to do with this.</strong></p>
<p>How?</p>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on that?</strong></p>
<p>Elaborate on what?</p>
<p><strong>What makes you believe elaborate on what?</strong></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>I would appreciate it if you would continue.</strong></p>
<p>Continue what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say continue what?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
<p>You don't make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of problems at school that you are going through all this?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not in school right now.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your school.</strong></p>
<p>I'm not in school right now.</p>
<p><strong>Does it bother you that your grades could improve?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not in school right now.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
<p>I am not annoyed that you asked that.</p>
<p><strong>Is it because I asked that that you came to me?</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand the question.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier you said I asked that?</strong></p>
<p>Is that a question?</p>
<p><strong>I need a little more detail please.</strong></p>
<p>You used a question mark at the end of a declarative statement. I don't know how to respond to that.</p>
<p><strong>You're being a bit brief, perhaps you could go into detail.</strong></p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p><strong>How do you reconcile any hobbies you have?</strong></p>
<p>What do hobbies have to do with anything? And why do hobbies need reconciling?</p>
<p><strong>When did you first know that do hobbies need reconciling?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know that hobbies need reconciling?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Neal Stephenson is obsessed with money. I'm reading
<a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0060523867/The+Confusion"><em>the Confusion</em></a> right now,
and as always, Eliza is trying to figure out <em>what</em> money is in order to learn
<em>how</em> to get more of it.</p>
<p>It's one of those subjects that I just don't get. What exactly backs a US Federal Reserve Note?<br />
I still can't figure that one out.</p>
<p>Originlly, the dollar was 24.06 g Ag or 1.60 g Au.<br />
Then it was 1.5 g Au. Then 0.89 g Au. Then 0.82 g Au.<br />
Now it's a piece of paper that can be taken to the loacal tavern and traded for alcohol. Good enough for me, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> Also note that the ratio of the dime to quarter is 10/25. Why? They were both originally siver coins, like the dollar itself. They were worth exactly thier weight in silver.</p>

<p><strong>Six Cups.</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the secret of Kyle's successful life.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a full pot of hot tea and a jug of cold tea. I felt very productive, and I was only able to sleep 7 hours. I'm going to do that every day.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/isbn/?0735710996"><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/linux_firewalls.jpg" alt="[book cover]" /></a></p>
<p>I've been using Ziegler's <em>Linux Firewalls (2nd Edition)</em> to teach myself <code>iptables</code> syntax. I'm not sure that it's the best book for getting started building firewalls and routers, bcause it advocates really compliated rulesets.</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/iptables.png" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>There are some basic facts about the way iptables works that aren't explained well. One of them is the diagram on the left. Everyone always draws it funny. The way I draw it, all packes travel downward.</p>
<p>Compare the <a href="http://www.linux-firewall-tools.com/ftp/firewall/optimized.firewall.2">giant scripts in Ziegler</a> to <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-5.html">Rusty's Really Quick Guide To Packet Filtering</a></p>
<p>When I was done confguring my router, I had a 61 line iptables script that blocked most ports, did SNAT and DNAT. I didn't feel the need to, for example, DROP packets on the OUTPUT chain.</p>
<p>Ziegler could use a chapter on troubleshooting with tcpdump and other tools.</p>

<p>The past few weeks I've been going to <a href="http://www.bluefinclub.com/">Bluefin</a> Monday nights. Here's why it's cool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open pool table.</li>
<li>Decent DJs. The layout of the club allows one to stand around watching the DJs spin. This is educational.</li>
<li>TVs. I get a chance to catch the <em>Daily Show</em>, which I normally miss due to lack of cable.</li>
<li>A playstation at the bar.</li>
<li>Cheap drinks.</li>
<li>No cover.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where people see the nature of their work as a reflection of their character‚Äîrather than seeing the market value of their work as a reflection of their worth.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where fraudulently putting one's name on another's work to make one appear a better artist is an utterly petty and ridiculous crime‚Äîas silly as putting one's name on another's photograph to make one's face more attractive.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where artists are paid for making art just as farmers are paid for making food‚Äîand where for an artist to control her art's evolution and growth is as unnatural as a farmer dictating how people may eat the food they buy from her.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where sacrificing wealth and comfort for the sake of knowledge and creativity is as noble as sacrificing wealth and comfort for the sake of family and friends‚Äîand where both choices are increasingly seen as avoidable ones.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I just got rhythmbox working for the first time. I needed to do a ‚Äúsudo yum install gstreamer-plugins-mp3‚Äù. Of course!</p>
<p>Review to follow.</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE 1:00 pm.</p>
<p>It would seem that I stayed out all night and then came home and figured out how to make rythembox work. Huh?</p>
<p>Okay. here's the deal. My distro, FC1, ships with a broken copy of xmms. You can get xmms-mp3 from the Livna.org repository, but xmms still looks like crap. So if you get Ryhtembox, its dependances (like gstreamer), and gstreamer-plugins-mp3, you get a much better music player.</p>
<p>F, it just hung. Damnit.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> I've been happy with rhythmbox for the last several months. I reccomend. Yet it still needs a few more features.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'd love to adopt Linux but am still trying to mount /dev/clue ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that's easy. First, download the latest 2.6 kernel (/dev/clue on 2.4 kernels is still experimental). Use a vanilla kernel, the clue patch is probably not working with the kernel your distro may offer. Then get the clue patch, apply it, recompile (configure the clue as module, building it directly into the kernel is not well tested), don't forget to make modules &amp;&amp; make modules_install. Install your new kernel (if you use LILO, dont forget to call /sbin/lilo) and reboot. Type modprobe clue. Then look in the proc filesystem if clue has properly initialized. If not, you might have to create a /etc/clue.conf for your system (see the Clue-device-HOWTO for details, but beware that some instructions there are out of date, so check the CHANGES file of the current release). As soon as everything is running, there should be the clue device in you /dev. Now you need to activate the clue filesystem (installed together with the clue device, just do modprobe cluefs). Now you can just issue the corresponding mount command (the exact options can be found on www.cluefaq.org), and voila. To have your clue activated and mounted automatically, you should adapt your modules.conf and fstab.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>From David Brooks' March 16 Column (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/16/opinion/16BROO.html">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am trying not to think harshly of the Spanish. They have suffered a grievous blow, and it was crazy to go ahead with an election a mere three days after the Madrid massacre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because democracy isn't worth it in the face of terrorism. The USA has suffered a grievous blow, and it would be crazy to go ahead with an presidential election a mere three years after the 9/11 massacre. Oh well, I guess that we'll just let GWB be president for life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nor is America itself without blame. Where was our State Department? Why hasn't Colin Powell spent the past few years crisscrossing Europe so that voters there would at least know the arguments for the liberation of Iraq, would at least have some accurate picture of Americans, rather than the crude cowboy stereotype propagated by the European media? Why does the Bush administration make it so hard for its friends? Why is it so unable to reach out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe because the war was <strong>unjustified</strong>? Maybe every time Colin Powell went to another country and asked for help, they asked for evidence against Iraq and he HAD NONE.</p>

<p>I just read Stephen Baxter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0006476201/theworldofhalcan"><em>Flux</em></a> again. I last read it in 11th grade, and I didn't appreciate it then much because the physics went right over my head. This is a book with prereqs. And yes, there are big flaws, but that's okay.</p>
<p>One flaw is that the government at the end seems determined to rebuild the world better than it was, to fix all of the problems that plague society. That's too unbelievable.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One-time pads are an old-fashoned way of doing cryptography, not used much these days. On the other hand, they are as secure as the random device is random. (Want a better random device? <a href="http://www.protego.se/sg100_en.htm">here's one</a>.)</p>
<p>I've been meaning to write this code for a while now:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
## crypt-otp.pl ##
if (@ARGV OUTPUT\n&quot;;
    exit 1;
}
my $a_file = shift @ARGV;
my $b_file = shift @ARGV;
open(OTP, &quot;&lt; $a_file&quot;);
open(PTX, &quot;&lt; $b_file&quot;);
while (read(PTX,$b,1)) {
    read(OTP,$a,1) or die &quot;Out of otp.&quot;;
    print $a ^ $b;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how to use it.</p>
<pre><code>$ head -c 10k /dev/random &gt; otp.data
$ ./crypt-otp.pl otp.data file &gt; file.crypt
$ ./crypt-otp.pl otp.data file.crypt | less
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how NOT to use it:</p>
<pre><code>$ perl -e 'for $x (1..1000) {print &quot;PASSWORD&quot;}' &gt; badotp
$ gzip &lt; file | ./crypt-otp.pl  badotp - &gt; x
$ ./crypt-otp.pl badotp x | gunzip - | less
</code></pre>
<p>If /dev/random hangs, jiggle your mouse for a while to build up entropy. If you input file is biger than your OTP, then it won't work. That's the one part of one-time. So make a bigger OTP by changing the argument to head.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html">A=B</a> on my cmputer and I thought: &quot;Gee, wouldn't it be nice to have this printed out and bound?&quot; It is 222 pages long. I could print it out myself and be out a bit of toner and half a ream of paper. Less than $3.</p>
<p>Then I thought, &quot;I could save paper by finding a duplex printer! Or even better, have Kinkos print out a copy and bind it. Maybe I'd pay a premium.&quot; I figured that would double the cost to have someone else press some buttons. No. $21.60. Can you believe that? I could buy a real copy of the book for that much!</p>

<p>WI has a hybrid paper/electronic system. I mark a very clear paper ballot with a felt-tip pen, then stick the paper into a scanner. The scanner tallies the votes, but the paper ballots are kept as a permanent record.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that this is the best voting system currently in use</p>
<p>Let's analyze this system for places where it could be potentially abused:</p>

<li>A voter can claim to be someone else and vote for them. I did not have to present any identification beyond knowing my street and last name. &quot;McDivitt Rd., Canary.&quot; An evildoer could pretend to be
<ul>
<li>Someone who has died, but was not purged from the rolls</li>
<li>Someone not likely to show at the polls</li>
<li>Someone who has moved to another precinct, but was not purged from the rolls</li>
<li>A person who exists only on paper. A False Identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An official, or group of officials at the voting location could fill out additional ballots, especially end of day, once they know who did not vote.</li>
<li>An official, or group of officials at the voting location could tamper with the machine that tallies the votes. (An audit would catch this, but how often does that happen.)</li>
<li>An official, or group of officials at the voting location could tamper with the machine that tallies the votes and destroy ballots to make the numbers come out correctly. (An audit would NOT catch this.)</li>
<li>The program that tallies the votes could lie. (OSS would help here.) See Diebold (<a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0309/S00106.htm">link</a>, <a href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/ISP_liability/OPG_v_Diebold/">link</a>, <a href="http://www.eff.org/Activism/E-voting/20030724_evote_research_report.pdf">link</a>.)</li>
<li>Someone up the line (election commission) could falsify data. (Only a large scale audit (statewide) would find this.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what would the perfectly trustworthy system look like? It would require <strong>permanent</strong>, <strong>positive</strong> certification of each vote cast. (Permanence allows for auditing.)</p>
<p>Solution: <strong>cypherpunk open voting system</strong>. Each voter provides positive proof that he is who he says he is and has the right to vote in a particular precinct and is not voting an another precinct. Then that voter hands the election commission a public key. That information: The voter's name, key, and location is signed by a public servant and published to the Internet and mirrored by anyone who wishes to have a privately controlled version of the election rolls. Then, if keys on the rolls spontaneously change, everyone will know. Each citizen later verifies that his information is correct. At election time, each voter creates a marked-ballot (a machine-created, human readable text document of some kind. It may be producible by way of a ECMAscript program that the voter runs on his own computer) then signs that marked-ballot and sends it to the election commission. The commission publishes all of these ballots. Then the citizen can verify that his ballot is published and corresponds to what he submitted. Any third party can download all of the ballots, verify each signature, and count the votes.</p>
<p>Of course, COVS has drawbacks. The ballot is no longer secret. It requires constant vigilance on the part of every citizen. It requires citizens to safeguard their private key. It would be difficult to authenticate every citizen, but once the system is in place, only new voters need to be authenticated. It requires sophisticated computer literacy on the part of every citizen. (Of course the current system presupposes normal literacy, which was uncommon 500 years ago.)</p>
<p>There's your tradeoff: privacy vs. auditability.</p>

#DTPD#
## ~/bin/wgeto¬†##
exec¬†wget¬†-o /dev/null -O - &quot;$@&quot;

<pre><code>$ wgeto¬†http://craphound.com/ebooksneitherenorbooks.txt \
   |¬†fold -s -w 70¬†|¬†less¬†
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation for non-unix-literate people: First of all, I wrote a neat script
called¬†<code>wgeto</code>. <code>wget</code>¬†is a program that downloads stuff off of the internet, via
http or ftp. wgeto¬†calls¬†wget, but tells it to ignore the progress dialog by
sending it to the null device, &quot;-o /dev/null&quot;. (See Rule of Silence from
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2878450"><em>The Art of Unix Programming</em></a>.)
<code>wgeto</code>¬†then pipes the document into standard output.</p>
<p>I pipe it through fold to wrap long lines</p>
<p>Then I pipe it into a pager, less, so that I can page through the document.</p>
<p>Now I don't have to save a copy on the hard disk.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, I felt that expressing the fear of censorship directly and repeatedly within the poem itself created an interesting tension. It emphasized that the poem had really been written by a human author with a human voice and his own interests and passions. Aware of the prospect of censorship, the poem confronts would-be censors directly and takes them to task. By contrast, most source code is relatively defenseless: it can't fight against its own suppression, and it gives less direct evidence of being in a human voice, leading some people to accept its stigmatization as &quot;merely mechanical&quot; or &quot;merely functional&quot;.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>He's too gullible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt confident that Bush would work with the international community. I took the President at his word. We were told that any course would lead through the United Nations, and that war would be an absolute last resort. Many people I am close with, both Democrats and Republicans, who are also close to Bush told me unequivocally that no decisions had been made about the course of action. Bush hadn't yet been hijacked by Wolfowitz, Perle, Cheney and that whole crew. Did I think Bush was going to charge unilaterally into war? No. Did I think he would make such an incredible mess of the situation? No. Am I angry about it? You're God damned right I am. I chose to believe the President of the United States. That was a terrible mistake.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The name of the <a href="http://www.democrats.org/blog/">DNC's blog is <em>Kicking Ass</em></a>. Ha!</p>
<p>Last night Mark and I ranted at each other for several hours. We want to come to the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thing are bad, but things have never ever really been good.</li>
<li>This country is run by them, and they won't do the right thing, no matter how many people rally against them. There is nothing we can do, not while the masses are . . . well, how they are.</li>
<li>So what if thousands of Iraqis died in the war? So what if hundred of Americans died and are dieing? There ain't much we could do about it anyway. This is still nothing compared to the second world war. In April 1862, 23000 people died over a two day period at Shiloh. None of the current troubles comes close to that, by an order of magnatude.</li>
<li>So what if our economy is screwed? It is screwed by the facts. Americans consume a large percentage of the resources of the planet. We can't keep that up, forever. Eventually, after enough high-paying jobs are exported to the rest of the world, we will reach a new equilibrium, where Americans are all just poorer. It'll be okay. We can't keep the rest of the planet down forever. Look, the dollar has already lost 29% of its value in the past two years. Only $0.71 left to go.</li>

<p><em>Home is behind, the world ahead,<br />
And there are many paths to tread<br />
Through shadows to the edge of night<br />
Until the stars are all alight.<br />
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade,<br />
Away shall fade ! Away shall fade!</em></p>
<p>‚ÄîTolkien(*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(*) In the movie <em>Return of the King</em> the original word of the walking song were altered. ‚ÄúMist and twilight‚Äù became ‚Äúmist and shadow.‚Äù Lines line ‚ÄúFire and lamp, and meat and bread,/And then to bed! And then to bed!‚Äù were left out because they were not sufficently moody.</p>
<p>I like the movie version.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Had a couple of odd dreams recently. A few nights ago, I had a dream that Iwas driving somewhere with Mark in his car and for some reason he had a trunk full of old clothes he wanted to donate to some organization. It was sunday morning and the usual suspects (goodwill, st. vinnie's) were closed. We just wated to get rid of them, so we decided to stop by a church that was supposed to have a place to take old clothes in the basement.</p>
<p>Mark had the wonderful idea of driving his car into the freight elevator to make this quicker, but then we couldn't get it out, and meanwhile we couldn't find where we were supposed to go and the church was filling up with people and it was one of these mega-churches and we were lost in the basement and they were mad that we had left a car in the elevator, but we couln't even <em>find</em> the elevator!</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream that I was wandering downtown and I wadered into a house and there were some evil people in the house and the house was full of secret passeges. Let this be a lesson to you: don't enter other people's houses!</p>
<p>The use of run-on sentences is deliberate when describing dreams.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I downloaded iTunes for windows the other day. I had seen the program before, most notably running the music for all of Aaron's partys for the last three years, abut I had not used it before.</p>
<p>It seems vastly superior to Windows Media Player, but I can't put my finger on how. Compared to Musicmatch Jukebox (which crashed whenever I tried to update my ipod), it is wonderful.</p>
<p>It would seem that the apple design philosophy is to hide most options from the user. So I had to go looking for help on turning on Manual Mode iPod syncing. Most users would have given up.</p>
<p>I've bought two albums on the iTMS. I'm not sure if that's a good thing yet.</p>
<p>My iPod playlist os now 1690 songs, 5.2days/7.19Gb of Music. I better go ahead and fill it up.</p>
<p>...Uh oh. I just got an error while updating the iPod. Hey, at least no programs crashed! I'll just reformat the disc. That usually helps, especially after a firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>And now It just lost most of my music library. I'll have to readd those files. And importing files into the library is the one thing that's not properly multithreaded.</p>
<p>I'll let you know how this works out.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's a recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get two slices of bread. (I like whole wheat)</li>
<li>Let some butter sit out for a few minutes, until it gets mushy. Noone likes firm butter.</li>
<li>Slice some cheese into thin slices. I like medium chedder or colby.</li>
<li>Get some thin slices of smaked turkey or other meat. I simply used lunch meat from the deli.</li>
<li>Put it all together: bread, layer of cheese, layer of meat, layer of cheese, and bread.</li>
<li>Then spread a large amount of butter evenly on the outside of the bread.</li>
<li>Put a pan on the stove. Heat to medium-hot.</li>
<li>Grill until the bttom layer of cheese looks kinda soft. Flip and repeat. Then flip once more for the fianl bit of toasting. Bread should be a beautiful golden color.</li>
<li>Cut in half.</li>
<li>Eat.</li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mark said some things the other day that I didn't respond to because I was drunk. Here we go:</p>
<p>General Platonism is the belief that there exist transcendent truths. That's it. Nothing more here. One of these truths is ‚Äú(ZFC) ‚áí (1+2=3)‚Äù. I won't even comment on whether or not ZFC is true.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, General Platonism is a belief, yes, but it cannot be considered a religion.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I woke up this morning and wandered into the living room. Other people bring home girls from parties, I have someone else's sparc-station sitting on my coffee table.</p>
<p>Yesterday I worked from home in the morning. I mangled my email with a photo: <img src="https://halcanary.org/images/email.png" alt="(my email address is my first name at this domain.)" /> I still don't know if that is a good or bad approach to reducing spam.</p>
<p>After some research, I now think it will be trivial to backport my java 1.2 applets to 1.1.</p>
<p>Went to the math colloqium. Didn't understand much, but there were pretty topology-type pictures. Also tried to socalize with mathematicians before-hand. Don't know enough of them.</p>
<p>Went to LUG, and got some pointers on iptables. Realized that I had met Staci at First Friday Party in past. Gave her ride to this one, but she left a sparc sation in my car. I brought it in out of the cold last night. That is why it's in my living room.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a html author, should I use</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a name=&quot;bleg&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a name=&quot;bleg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Text?
</code></pre>
<p>It only matters if one has defined something in css for &quot;<code>a:hover</code>&quot;. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#x33">The W3C</a> doesn't specify that <code>:hover</code> should apply to any specific element. So one could define css:</p>
<pre><code>span.highlight:hover {
  background-color:#ffffaa;
  color:#000000; }
</code></pre>
<p>and use html:</p>
<pre><code>words, &lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
 words,&lt;/span&gt; words!
</code></pre>
<p>All this implies that I should make a point to immediately close <code>&quot;&lt;a name=...&quot;</code> tags, unless I want highlighting.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I slept in some, but not as much as I thought I would need. Washed some dishes. Burned two cd's from <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune's</a> Electronica mp3 collection. Caught 9:50 bus.</p>
<p>Went to class. Learned about free groups and free products.</p>
<p>If I were a buddist philosopher, I would write a book called <em>The Big Book of Buddah</em>. (It's an alliteration, see?)</p>
<p>Tried to study for ssl, didn't learn much, but instead I took nap. Nice nap.</p>
<p>Went to SSL. Today was individual meetings with Jim. Much more fun was brainstorming with the kids. (I include John as a kid even though he is probably five years older than me.) We decided to meet Monday at 3:30 for more fun. I don't want to be a serious mathematician if it means being serious all the time.</p>
<p>Put out <a href="https://halcanary.org/SSL/">v1.2 of TOAD Shuffler</a>. (Took ~2 hours)</p>
<p>Went to store and bought many 2liters of diet dr.p.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>After class I went downtown and wandered around. It was too cold, so I went into a coffee shop and studied topology. I learned about the fundamental group of the real projective plane and of the wedge product of two real projective panes, among other things. Tonight I went out and drank.</p>
<p>Still no luck on port forwarding</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm thinking about trying to blog more often. Try and update daily. We'll see how that works out. I do enjoy reading <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~telsa/Diary/diary.html">other people's diaries sometimes</a>.</p>
<p>Spent most of yesterday learning about iptables, routing, and nat. Still can't print on computer behind the firewall from computer outside the firewall. This type of command should do it, but it doesn't.</p>
<p>/sbin/iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING \
-p tcp -i eth0 --dport 663 \
-j REDIRECT --to 192.168.1.11:663</p>
<p>Also went to class yesterday. Took good notes.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I played around with Movable Type this weekend. I liked it, but have a couple of issues. I think it should come with a couple of dozen stylesheets for users to choose from. I spent an hour playing with CSS before I got <a href="https://halcanary.org/vv/">something I liked</a>.</p>
<p>The one thing I don't like is that it groups entries by date. That seems very unnatural.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I am giving up on Debian Linux. I tried installing it for a headless server and it worked great--but was running a 2.2 kernel. So I install the 2.4.x kernel with apt-get, and reboot. Well, the install program modified lilo incorrectly and ran /sbin/lilo, so it was broken and failed to boot. I go in and fix lilo, and get it to boot the 2.4 kernel, but suddenly it no longer is loading the correct module for the net card. At this point I decided to give up on this.</p>

<p>I'm sick the weekly asshole killing innocents and avoiding the consequences of his action through suicide.</p>
<p>I'm sick of Ariel Sharon building a apartheid state in Palestine.</p>
<p>I'm sick of the Nobel Prize committee giving a peace prize to avowed terrorist Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>I'm sick of George W. Bush, an devout Christian, chumming it up with Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz at the ranch, when Abdullah is the ruling dictator of a country where it is illegal to celebrate the Eucharist in public.</p>
<p>I'm sick of George Bush, who said in 2000 that his favorite philosopher is Jesus Christ, interpreting &quot;Turn the other cheek&quot; to mean &quot;Bomb another country, just to prove that your testicles are bigger than everyone else's.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm sick of every member of every army in the world, who all think that the commandment THOU SHALT NOT KILL somehow doesn't apply to them.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It was cool last niught and I had my window open. I slept well and woke up 90 seconds before the alarm. Somehow that inspired me to have the most interesting dream.</p>
<p>I was flying somewhere, after not flying in years. I was still afraid of surfacte-to-air missiles, but fiinally decided that I could take a chance on air travel again. I had jsut got on the plane when I had a vision. The plane was not going to make it to its destination. I got off of the plane before it left the gate. As I was leaving, I noiticed that the pilot who was boarding looked drunk or ill.</p>
<p>As I stod in the terminal, I watched the plane take off, and then crash into the ground. My fears were justified. I got out my cell and called for a ride home. I immediately got a couple of messages from people who wanted to know if I was alive.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the terminal, a female security guard asked me to come with her. I obliged, until she led me into a scary part of the airport. Then I said I didn't want to come with her, or I would be happy to talk to her, but maybe in a nice conference room somewhere. Another security guard walked up then, noticed that I was making trouble and pulled a gun on me. The first guard told the second that he shouldn't point a gun at me, but he didn't listen. I fought the second guard, and managed to shoot him in the fight. I then unloaded the pistol and threw it away. I then told the first guard to get lost. I ran.</p>
<p>When I got outside, my ride pulled up. This was a skinny punky girl who only appears in this dream. She was driving crazy and I told her that we had to make a fast getaway. She stepped on it and drove down the wrong way down one of those one way drives at the airport. I mentioned that we would probably attract less attention if we went the right way and drove casual.</p>
<p>That's where I woke up.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been playing <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">SubSpace/Continuum</a> (it's like a massively multiplayer Maelstrom) and it's gotten me thinking. I'd like to see a cross between subspace and an rpg. For lack of a better name, I'm calling it <em>rocket science</em>.</p>
<p>You start by building a 2-d model of the solar system. It would consist of objects and artifacts. Objects are things like stars, planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. Artifacts are things like communication satelites, telescopes, spaceships, missiles, space stations, and asteroid settlements. The position and velocity of each object are well known to all players. There may be thousands of objects in the game.</p>
<p>object atributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>position</li>
<li>velocity</li>
<li>mass: if the mass is too small to create an aprecible g-field, ignore it</li>
<li>radius. If the radius is very small ( &lt; 10^3 m) ignore collisions.</li>
<li>an image: what it looks like (asteroids can look alike.)</li>
</ol>
<p>artifact atributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>position</li>
<li>velocity</li>
<li>mass: in case you want to accelerate it.</li>
<li>visibility. Obviously a ship with fusion engine on will be more visible than a dead ship.</li>
<li>an image: what it looks like</li>
<li>Orientation and acceleration (or thrust)</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be acceptible to treat small asteroids as artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>professions/factions:</strong></p>
<p>There is an economy to this game. You can use this to your advantage if you become a merchant. You can buy He3 cheaply at Jupiter, and sell it for more money at Earth orbit. Or buy metals in the Belt and sell them somewhere else.</p>
<p>The next profession is pirate. Why buy goods when it is so much cheaper to gust take what you want?</p>
<p>To deal with the piracy problem, there is the bounty-hunter's guild. They recieve money for killing pirates.</p>
<p>To pay for the bounty hunters, there is a tax on merchants. Some avoid paying taxes by becoming smugglers.</p>
<p>There are IRS agents running around trying to kill smugglers.</p>
<p>There could be other professions: construction, mining, etc.</p>
<p><strong>user interface</strong></p>
<p>If course, if the ui is no good, this boat won't fly. First of all, you need to be able to zoom from 1 meter resolution to 10^12 meter resolution. Second, you need an autopilot that is capable of plotting a course to anywhere. Otherwise, players would always be crashing into the sun, or unable to find neptune.</p>
<p>And fuel should not be free.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/sh
#DTPD#
## $HOME/bin/ssh ##
if ! (ssh-add -l &gt; /dev/null); then
  ssh-add;
fi
echo ssh &quot;$@&quot;;

<p>Of course you have to have the ssh-agent working correctly in the first place.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/honda-robot-1.png" alt="honda robot" />The <a href="http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm">third part of Marshall Brain's essay on robots</a> is out. Also check out <a href="http://www.marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm"><em>Manna</em></a>, a work of fiction.</p>
<p>Brain gives two possibilities. Utopia and distopia. I have the feeling that the future, a usual, lies between.</p>

<p>And on the right is a work in progress. All I can say is that it is less ugly now than it was last night.</p>

The most important thing about this piece is mixing good looking colors. That blue needs work.</p>

<p>I bought a new used bike last month. It's nice, but it's a bit too hot during the month of August to want to ride it long distances. I plan on making it my primary mode of transportation as soon as September brings cooler weather.</p>
<p>I picked up a headlamp for my bike today. My old lamp, which I lost, was 15 years old, used C batteries (who has those?), and tended to slide off the handle. The new one uses AA's, and can be unclipped from the (very secure) mounting to serve as a flashlight.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm reading <em>Komarr</em> by Lois Bujold. It's another one of her space operas, but this one is seriously lacking in spaceships so far.</p>
<p>I don't know how I'm going to fix my sleep schedule so that I can attend 8:30 classes. I might have to resort to coffee. I wonder how old those coffee beans are? I bought them when I lived on Vilas. I really haven't drunk much coffee since I was an undergrad. Do coffee beans get stale?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to play Civ III on my computer. It required booting into windows. Now don't get me wrong, Windows XP is a fine operating system....for playing games on. I'd hate to have a job where I was required to do any work on such a machine. Or if I had such a job, I'd quit it after 18 months.</p>
<p>Windows has been unable to boot since I put in a new motherboard and processor. So I took this opportunity to reinstall windows and repartition /dev/hda. (You can't fit windows XP on 2GB. Don't even try.) Of course the istallation wrote over my master boot record. I had a little problem restoring it. I'll let you know what I ended up doing in case it ever helps someone else. (Although I think my setup is probably unique.)</p>
<ol>
<li>put in redhat install disk. Boot into rescue mode. It will mount your filesystmes under <code>/mnt/sysimage</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>/boot</code> is a seperate partition, unmount it first: &quot;<code>umount /mnt/sysimage/boot</code>&quot;.</li>
<li><code>chroot /mnt/sysimage</code></li>
<li>remount the <code>/boot</code> partition: &quot;<code>mount /dev/hdb1 /boot</code>&quot;.</li>
<li><code>grub-install '(hd0)'</code></li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/photos/2003-08-15-dalek-media-pc.jpg"><img src="https://halcanary.org/photos/thumb/2003-08-15-dalek-media-pc.jpg" alt="[Thumb]" /></a></p>
<p>As I've mentioned before, I'm putting together a media pc. I started with my old computer, <em>dalek</em>, and put it in a new case. Then I hooked the video card's s-video output up to my television and the sound up to my stereo. When I tried to turn it on two days ago nothing happened. So I went to bed. Yesterday, I opened it up and found that the power supply was not plugged into the motherboard snugly. After fixing that, it booted.</p>
<p>It is running Knoppix off of a CD. Right now, XFree86 is not sending the TV a good signal, so I'm stuck in console mode. So no watching movies on dalek yet. But I did pop in a CD full of mp3's and it could play them using mpg123.</p>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get XFree86 working.</li>
<li>Play DVDs</li>
<li>Get my router working.</li>
<li>Get dalek onto the network.</li>
<li>Share music &amp; video from lensman's harddrive using samba.</li>
<li>Play video games with emulators.</li>
</ol>
<p>That photo I just took is meant to show one thing. Since it's a black case, it doesn't stand out much. Which is exactly how things should be. It's just another component in my A/V system. Eventually, the system should consist of (1) a media pc, (2) an amplifier &amp; speakers and (3) a screen.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-12-02:</strong> A while back I broke down and threw a 8 GiB HDD into dalek and installed FC. This eventually got 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 working. I use scp instead of samba. I just don't trust samba.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For a while, I've been upset at the sorry state of emacs. It is not <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG-compliant</a>, and it doesn't use anti-aliased fonts. It is really a pain to remap all of the keybindings for emacs. And when you have three or more buffers open, it's a pain to switch between them.</p>
<p>So I've decided to abandon the one true editor.</p>
<p>First candidate for Hal's new editor: <strong>vim</strong>. I quickly dropped that when I realized that I didn't want to learn a whole new set of arcane keybindings.</p>
<p>Candidate 2: <strong>gedit</strong>. The default editor for my desktop of choice: Gnome. It has anti-aliased fonts and tabs, which I like, but lacks any other useful features.</p>
<p>Candidate 3: <a href="http://eturquin.free.fr/beaver/"><strong>beaver</strong></a>. Beaver is a gtk+ editor that tries to be exactly what I want. It has tabs, syntax highlighting, gtk2 toolkit, and anti-aliased fonts. But it's still rough around the edges. I think it really wants to be adopted by the Gnome project.</p>
<p>Candidate 4: <strong>kate</strong>. Kate is the advanced editor for KDE. I don't really like KDE as much as Gnome, but ome of tha apps are okay. KDE has one great feature that is integreated into all of its apps: network transparency. At the command line, I can type</p>
<pre><code>kate ftp://XXX@halcanary.org/public\_html/index.cgi
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>kate sftp://ups.physics.wisc.edu/home/hal/note-.txt
</code></pre>
<p>and it asks for a password and opens up the document in a local window. This is <em>beautiful</em>. It also has really good syntax highlighting. It does not have tabs, but it is easy to switch between buffers with alt-rightarrow and alt-leftarrow. It's also easy to edit the keybindings. I just made ctrl-w an alternate for close, and ctrl-[shift]-tab for forward[backward].</p>
<p>Also note that KDE is the desktop on Knoppix. Anywhere I can stick in a Knoppix CD, I can use kate to edit files locally.</p>

			<title>Hippy Christmas/Dreams</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is hippy christmas. I should go downtown, wander around, and look for good junk. For those not in the know, leases for students in downtown Madison traditionally run from August 15 to August 14. Consequently, everyone is homeless for 24 hours. Another consequence is that there a lot of abandned junk on the street. I don't really need any junk, but I might find a few gems.</p>
<p>I had some odd dreams last night. The first involved a couple of somewhat evil time travelers showing up in my apartment. They roughed my up, then I demanded that they tell me something cool so that I'd know that they were from the future. They told me about an undiscovered island near Myanmar. Supposedly there was somemthing cool there. (Very old-school sci-fi, huh?)</p>
<p>The second phase of my dreaming was odd. I go over to help a friend move and he asks if I'm moving. Then I suddenly realize that my lease is up today. I have to go home and pack my things! But then I remember that I renewed my lease. Then suddenly I'm back in my three bedroom apartment on Vilas Ave. One roommate has already moved out and taken off for Africa, and the other is waiting until the last minute to move out. But I've renewed the lease, and I have to find two new roomates. Luckilly the apartment has been transformed into a rather large house with hardwood floors.</p>
<p>For some reason Jenn is in town on business and she stays with me since I have a unused room. The Vilas House (which only exists in my dream) had a couple of large empty rooms and a kitchen on the first floor. The front room had a single couch a TV. Jenn mostly sat on the couch and played video games while she was around; I did not talk to her much.</p>
<p>The second floor had two bedrooms, and a large open space with a balcony overlooking a room on the first floor. There was a third floor, which consisted of that twisty room that Jill had lived in.</p>
<p>Then people started showing up. At first there were a couple of aquantences I knew who were in town for a wedding. I let them sleep in the empty dining room because that had nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>Then a large number of people I didn't know who were in town for a church convention showed up. They had heard that I had space for people to crash. I said that they could sleep on the floor, but they didn't like that option. So they eventually left. I thought about building bunk beds and starting a flophouse, but I decided that was a bad idea. This house was meant for cooler things.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>HST is a bit of a pessimist about things, huh?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The American nation is in the worst condition I can remember in my lifetime, and our prospects for the immediate future are even worse. I am surprised and embarrassed to be a part of the first American generation to leave the country in far worse shape than it was when we first came into it. Our highway system is crumbling, our police are dishonest, our children are poor, our vaunted Social Security, once the envy of the world, has been looted and neglected and destroyed by the same gang of ignorant greed-crazed bastards who brought us Vietnam, Afghanistan, the disastrous Gaza Strip and ignominious defeat all over the world.</p>
<p>The Stock Market will never come back, our Armies will never again be No. 1, and our children will drink filthy water for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>The Bush family must be very proud of themselves today, but I am not. Big Darkness, soon come. Take my word for it.</p>
<p>‚Äî<a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/thompson/030722.html">Hunter S. Thompson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's this essay-in-progress: <a href="http://marshallbrain.com/robots-in-2015.htm">Robots in 2015</a>. Marshall Brain predicts that better robots (ATM-like waiters, AI, self-checkout lanes, robotic shelf sockers, and RFID tags) will cause massive layoffs in the service industry. This will lead to the end of the world as we know it.</p>
<p>The simple fact is: we as a global society are going to have to learn to evolve quickly. We are going to have to learn to sit up and pay attention to the world.</p>
<p>What we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct Democracy: we badly need a proof of concept on this one. Problems: how to prevent massive deficits and bread &amp; circuses? How do we protect basic civil rights? how do we keep corporate oligarchies from running things? How does one maintain a dialog that noone is left out of?</li>
<li>Ways to educate the lower class out of the low end jobs that will shortly cease to exist for them. Have we ever been successfull at this? Is this a manageable goal?</li>
<li>An economy that works when there is nothing to export and no jobs for 50% of the populations. Real wages per hour worked will have to go up even while prices fall; that way we can all take turns at the jobs that do exist. In other words: shorter work weeks, long periods of unemplyment, and long vacations. Two weeks of vacation a year at Epic was bullshit. That's why I quit. Eighteen month vacation is more like it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I always wanted to write a modern retelling of the <em>Iliad</em>, either a novel or a rock opera, but both would be out of reach of my skill.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Here's your basic shish-kabob, using my favorite general-purpose meat: chicken.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take your chicken breasts out of the freezer. Cut each breast into aprroximately six equal-sized chunks. Marinate in a lot of black pepper, lemon pepper, some random herbs from your garden, and the chicken's own juices.</li>
<li>Wait 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cut up a several bell peppers of different colors into 8-12 large pieces. (Remember that non-green bell peppers are more expensive, so you don't have to buy more than one token pepper of each color.)</li>
<li>Cut an onion up into little pieces.</li>
<li>Also have little tomatoes and mushrooms.</li>
<li>Invite your guests to build thier own kabobs. Audience paricipation makes everything more fun. Differenciate your kabobs by having different items on the ends.</li>
<li>Grill over hot charcoals until meat is nolonger raw and veggies are well burnt. Don't forget to rotate and flip.</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've decided to do a few upgrades on my two year old computer. For some reason my old mobo would balk if I put in more than 256MB of RAM.</p>
<p>So I began by buying a new motherboard+processor+RAM: an Athlon XP 2200+ and a ASUS A7N8X. I'll stick that in my old case and keep my old drives in that case. I'll probably end up giving it a new name. Possibly <em>lensman</em>.</p>
<p>Then I'll put my old mobo+processor (still called <em>dalek</em>) in a new case in my living room. Just to keep things simple I'll run Knoppix on that machine so that I don't have to worry about hard drives. Then I can play music off of a nfs mounted drive from lensman.</p>

<p>Code from <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2003-02/msg00652.html">This message</a></p>
<p>I've been working on this for a while now. I'd like to produce a .emacs file that will completely remap the keybindings to <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/userinput.html#standard-shortcuts">some kind of standard</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest problem seems to be the ctrl-x and ctrl-c behavior.</p>
<p><a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2003-02/msg00652.html">To those in the emacs community who say that the default behavior is superior</a>, I won't disagree. But ctrl-f is search in my browser, and whenever I hit ctrl-s to search, it tries to save the web page. So I figured I needed to retrain myself and emacs to a single standard.</p>

<p>I found some cool old photos floating around my hard drives. This one's a gem. Also check out <a href="http://nuclear.physics.wisc.edu/~chapman/pictures/">Mark's Photos</a>, which have been updated recently.</p>
<p>Looking at old photos it would seem that I gained a lot of weight while working at Epic. Desk jobs suck. Maybe I've got enough self control to stick to diet and excercise. But I doubt it.</p>

<p>I learned a few cool things recently. How to rotate an image with the gimp (especially useful when there is a horizonatal horizon): Use the transform tool. I had never noticed that button before; I kept looking for rotation in the context menu, but that's the wrong place to look.</p>
<p>Also, if you've got a B&amp;W printer and want to print off a color image, use the &quot;convert -charcoal&quot; command to create a new image.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>90% of the time you use a <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> you are putting a divider between sections or subsections that are already (or should already) be divided by <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>'s or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>'s. Instead use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s to break up sections and subsections. So</p>
<pre><code class="language-HTML">&lt;!--document.html--&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code class="language-HTML">&lt;!--document.html--&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The following css will produce a <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> style border:</p>
<pre><code class="language-CSS">/* style.css */
div.section {
  border-bottom:
  solid 3px #000000 ;
}
</code></pre>
<p>At this point you can have more fun with the css, without touching the html any more. (Isn't that the point?) Try putting each <code>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;</code> in its own little colorful box.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Getting my Canon PowerShot A40 working under RedHat Linux 7.3 with gphoto2</p>
<p><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/A40.jpg" alt="pic of A40" /></p>
<p>Before you start, glance through the gphoto2 man page.</p>
<h2>Getting gphoto2 to recognize the A40</h2>
<p>First of all, check the version of gphoto2</p>
<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/gphoto2 -v
gPhoto (v2.0) - Cross-platform digital camera library.
Copyright (C) 2000,2001 Scott Fritzinger and others
Licensed under the Library GNU Public License (LGPL).

$ /usr/bin/gphoto2 -L
ERROR: Please specify a model.
*** Error ('Unknown model') ***

For debugging messages, please use the --debug option.
Debugging messages may help finding a solution to your problem.
If you intend to send any error or debug messages to the gphoto
developer mailing list &lt;gphoto-devel@gphoto.org&gt;, please run
gphoto2 as follows:

    env LANG=C gphoto2 --debug -L

Please make sure there is sufficient quoting around the arguments.
</code></pre>
<p>Version 2.0 does not support the A40, so you'll have to try a command line that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ gphoto2 --usbid 0x04a9:0x3058=0x04a9:0x304e -L
</code></pre>
<p>But a better solution would be to download version 2.1 from <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gphoto/gphoto2-2.1.0.tar.gz">sourceforge</a>. gPhoto v2.1.0 supports the A40. You'll have to build from the source.</p>
<p>Now, su to root, and try</p>
<pre><code>$ gphoto2 -v
gPhoto (v2.1.0) - Cross-platform digital camera library.
Copyright (C) 2000-2002 Scott Fritzinger and others
Licensed under the Library GNU Public License (LGPL).

$ gphoto2 -L
Detected a 'Canon PowerShot A40'.
There are no files in folder '/'.
There are no files in folder '/DCIM'.
There are 2 files in folder '/DCIM/100CANON':
#1     IMG\_0020.JPG               rd   458 KB image/jpeg
#2     IMG\_0021.JPG               rd   429 KB image/jpeg
There are no files in folder '/DCIM/CANONMSC'.
</code></pre>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>I got most of this from <a href="http://n-dimensional.de/projects/digicam/The_gPhoto2_Manual/html/permissions-usb.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Don't want to have to su to root all of the time? Let's get the hotplug set up so that we don't have to worry about it. In this case, we'll just want whoever has ownership of /dev/console to be able to access any usb devices on the machine. The important files should libe in /etc/hotplug.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>$ cd /etc/hotplug/</li>
<li>$ cp usb.usermap usb.usermap.old</li>
<li>Edit usb.usermap. Remove all lines that start with the word usbcam.</li>
<li>$ gphoto2 --print-usb-usermap &gt;&gt; usb.usermap</li>
<li>Make sure that there is a script called /etc/hotplug/usb/usbcam</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that's all I had to do.</p>

The only problem is that you need a very expensive ADC to pick up <a href="http://comsec.com/wiki?HowtoHdTv">FM or HDTV</a>.</p>
<p>If software defined radio ever becomes really common, maybe the price of the hardware will drop. It seems to me that an ADC is such a horribly useful piece of equipment that every computer should come with one. It's refreashing to see that the free software sommunity is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/">so far ahead in this game</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone I know has an old ADC card laying about and wants to work on building something cool, tell me.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Comics</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/"><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/planetary.jpg" alt="Elijah Snow" /></a> I've been reading comics recently. Working my way through Warren Ellis' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563896486/theworldofhalcan"><em>Planetary</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1563894459/theworldofhalcan"><em>Transmetropolitan</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first two volumes of <em>Planetary</em> are great, but the crossover books I read really didn't have much going for them. For instance, <em>Planetary/Authority</em> book shows the weakness of the the idea of having comic book universes. If both the Planetary organization and the Authority exist in the Wildstorm universe, then why doesn't Elijah Snow just call for the Authority's help in getting rid of the Four? That would seem to be a task better suited to a team of overpowered superheros than a team of overpowered archaeologists.</p>
<p><em>Transmet</em>, on the other hand, is flawless so far. This shows the importance of having well-rounded characters.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Driving</strong></p>
<p>I used to share a flat with a guy named Andy Szudy. He had a habit of jumping in a car on summer evenings and driving around the Wisconsin countryside. I didn't understand the urge that well, but this summer I've got the bug. I just drove out to the video store and thouroughly enjoyed driving through the cool night.</p>
<p>I kind of want to get in the car and take off. Unfortunately, I have nowhere to go.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>high-speed internet</h2>
<p>I got cable modem service last week. This is the first time I've had a high speed connection at my house, and here is what I think:</p>
<p>All in all, it's a good idea. A bit expensive, but these things can be budgeted for.</p>
<h2>bittorrent</h2>
<p><a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a> is awesome. Because the load is distributed evenly, you can get the full use of whatever bandwidth you have.</p>
<p>I love how the program is so minimalistic. Compare to Kazaa, which is a huge executable that only seems to run on Windows. It achieves this minimality by using existing httpd clients/servers to not only deliver the .torrent metafiles, but also information about and links to the torrents in normal text/html.</p>
<p>It's annoying when servers deliver .torrent files as text/plain instead of application/x-bittorrent.</p>
<h2>hardware addiction</h2>
<p>With all of the crap I'm downloading, I may need to get a new hard drive soon. Right now I have two 30 GB drives. If I replaced one of them with a 120 GB drive, then I'd have two and a half times as much storage. If I had a mobo with more than two IDE channels, I could have more than four devices. But I really shouldn't spend any more money on hardware. Instead I'll spend it on blank CD-Rs.</p>
<h2>the urge to game</h2>
<p>I read a review of <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/">Star Wars Galaxies</a> the other day. Made me want to see the game. Explore it for a few weeks, at least. Their pricing model discourages the casual gamer. It's $12 to $15 per month plus $50 up front for the game. If they were really confidant that the game was fun, it would be $20 up front for the first month and $20/per month after that. If they can keep a gamer for a year they've more than broke even. But $50 is a bit much for a game that I might want to stop playing the first month.</p>
<p>And I'm certainly not paying $80 for the collectors edition since the standard edition is sold out. `</p>
<p>This is a well established business principle. Give away the razor and profit on the blades.</p>
<p>I't just as well that I'm not going to get the game. I'd just have to use windows anyways. And that would be distasteful.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Drove down to the North Carolina/Tennessee Mountains. Backpacked for a week or so. Wandered around Great Smokey Mountains National Park.</p>
<p>Then I realized that I was extremely lonely out there in the middle of the woods without anyone to talk to. This was about the time I finished the only book I took with me, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.</p>
<p>I then drove down to Ft. Myers to visit my parents. My mother had just bought a second house as an investment. I took it upon myself to get the front yard loking decent, so I spent a week weeding and putting down mulch. I also drove down to the everglades.</p>
<p>Then it was time to go to Memphis for Ben and Julie's wedding. I spent a night with some friends of my parents, and two nights at Scott's house.</p>
<p>The wedding itself was interesting. I hadn't seen any of my high school friends in a couple of years. Memphis now seems like an alien place.</p>
<p>Now I'm back in Madison.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://halcanary.org/art/devil-04.jpg"><img src="https://halcanary.org/art/thumb/devil-04.jpg" alt="watercolor of Devil's Lake, WI" /></a> I stayed up til dawn last night. Insomnia led to one of the most productive days in months. I spent a lot of time cleaning up the mp3's on my hard drive. The problem was that I had not decided how to go about organizing them until I had already massed a couple of gigs of them. Each file should have a correct id3 tag and a filename of<br />
<code>$HOME/Music/[genre]/[artist]/[artist]_-_[album]_[track]_[title].mp3</code>.</p>
<p>A lot of my old files had filenames that included spaces or non-ascii characters. These are a pain in the ass when your main mp3 player is command line mpg123. What kind of idiot came up with the concept of spaces in filenames anyways?</p>
<p>I now have 8 240 250 880 bytes of music.</p>
<p>I also paid my bills, cleaned my apartment, did dishes, folded laundry, threw out old clothes, and reorganized parts of my closet.</p>
<p>As of June 2, my 273 phone number will cease to work. When I get back to town at the end of the summer, I will finally be forced to get high speed internet access. I find it off that internet connection costs never seem to go down. You would think that as the technology continued to mature, costs would go down. I have some bad habits when it comes to keeping track of pieces of paper. I tend to organize them by placing them in little stacks and the forgetting about them until I realize that all of these stcks of paper have now bneen mixed together again and need to be resorted before I can find anything again. If only I could just throw things away sooner.</p>
<p>I have reciepts for every dollar I've spent for the past six years. I have never once looked at a single one after it went into the pile.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When you give your address or email to any corporate entity, they immediately begin to junkmail/spam you. But I need that line of communication. I have to check every piece of mail that looks like it comes from my phone company, insurance company, bank, credit card company, etc; any envelope might contain a bill, and I'd be stupid to forget to pay it. I wish I could have a spam filter for my mailbox that would reject anything which was not a bitt or personal correspondance.</p>
<p>If I gave all of these people my email address for an electronic bill, they'd just take that as an invitation to spam me, and I'd be even less likely to find the signal within the noise.</p>
<p>And forget automatic bill payment. Why would I trust an automatic system to find errors in bills?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's a rainy grey week. That's okay, because the plants need rain. But it had better brighten up soon.</p>
<hr />
<h2>This summer.</h2>
<p>I don't know if I've mentioned my plans for the summer yet. I'm going to go hike pieces of the <a href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org/">appalachian trail</a>. Here's the plan :</p>
<ol>
<li>Next week and the week after: Take exams</li>
<li>The week after next: Find apartment for next fall, start packing up my things, rent storage location, get new cell phone. Buy new tent, backpack. Order more maps of the trail.</li>
<li>The weekend of the 17th. Do some hiking and camping. Shakedown.</li>
<li>The Week of the 18th: Move all of my possession into (1) Storage and (2) my car. Buy a lot of food for the trip (Plan on buying more along the way). Liquify investments to pay for summer. Set up automatic bill payments for most bills. Cancel phone. Have mail forwarded to &lt;where?&gt;. Tell landlord I'm gone; turn in keys.</li>
<li>Weekend of the 24th: Party. When I'm sober again, begin drive east towards misty mountains. (Don't forget to budget for gas. Thank Allah we won the last war.)</li>
<li>Go to somewhere on the southern end of the trail, park car and begin hiking. Buy more food as appropriate. After 10 days, turn around and hike back to car.</li>
<li>Weekend of June 20-22: Visit Memphians. Attend a wedding. Get smashed and embarass the bride and groom.</li>
<li>After that, go back to AT. Hike loops in VA and parts north. Visit family and friends in DC area. Meet parents in DC.</li>
<li>Spend two more months doing that.</li>
<li>Be back in Madison by September 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should be fun.</p>

<h2>Even More Linux Crap</h2>
<p>We installed rh9 onto the ups server/workstation. Gnome is not useable on a pII-233, and there are no smaller windowmanagers. So we installed windowmaker. I find that using <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/wmbuildmenu/">this script</a> helps with getting the windowmaker menus into good shape.</p>
<p>Linux on the Vaio is utterly unusable right now. I'm not going to fool with it any more for a while. The other day, I booted into windows, installed <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">phoenix</a> and got some work done...by sshing into a linux server and doing my work there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Happy Good Friday. Except that it's not a particularly happy holiday. It's all about sin and death. [Hal rummages through his old tapes.] Here we go: my copy of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. No holy week could be complete without a thourough listening to JCS. I'll probably play some Bach passions as well.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Note: the fact that .Xdefauts doesn't work is due to the fact that the file has been renamed .Xresources.</p>
<p>I tried installing Red Hat 9 onto my Vaio SRX87 this week. The install program did see my hard drive and firewire CD-Rom. I repartitioned and installed. Everything worked great, except for:</p>
<ol>
<li>modem. I need to search for linmodem drivers</li>
<li>wireless. It was not auto detected, as far as I can tell. Maybe there's a simple workaround.</li>
<li>plug and play usb keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>The usb-uhci kernal modult keeps giving error messages.</li>
<li>No way to adjust display brightness to save battery life.</li>
<li>No Hibernation.</li>
<li>Some other instabilities, possibly due to usb-uhci errors</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all possible show stoppers. So I wiped the hard drive and reallocated 9 Gb for windows and 11 Gb for linux partitions. Now it's a dual boot system.</p>
<p>It's a great computer, but Sony needs to get behind OSS.</p>
<p>My next project is to upgrade the ups server/workstation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I have an exam friday evening at 6:30. Can you believe that?</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I bought a copy of Red Hat 9 today. I've got the hang of installing new linux distros. Just don't format over the /home and /usr/local partitions and remember where you wrote down the phone number for your ppp connection. And don't forget that the modem is /dev/ttyS4, not /dev/ttyS0; that mistake cost me an hour.</p>
<p>My review: Not much different than 8.0. It feels more like a point release. Does not come with Windowmaker, so I'm not sure how well that will work on a older machine. I'm back to using Bluecurv-themed Gnome. It works okay.</p>
<p>Problems with Gnome 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>No shortcut key to logout. (I submitted a bug report on that.)</li>
<li>needs to run 'xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults' on login. (Fixable)</li>
<li>Not as fast loading as Windowmaker (but faster than Gnome 1.x).</li>
<li>No native gtk music player. Xmms simply isn't good enough; it looks like crap.</li>
<li>Fonts in Open Office need fixing. I hear that Ximian is working on this.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make a usable system, I have to install the following software in /usr/local:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phoenix with nice fonts - browser.</li>
<li>Flash plugin for Phoenix.</li>
<li>mpg123 - tui mp3 player.</li>
<li>mplayer and w32 codecs - video player.</li>
<li>scripts for '/sbin/ifup ppp$N' and '/sbin/ifdown ppp$N'.</li>
<li>BladeEnc - mp3 encoder. (Yes, I know about Ogg Vorbis; but until both of my mp3 players support it, it doesn't work. I keep waiting for Apple to release a software update for the iPod for Ogg.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I'm suprised at how few things need to be in /usr/local. I went through and cleaned up that partition for the first time in years.</p>
<p>To do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to get my iPod to play nice with linux. With previous kernel versions, using the firewire card caused kernel errors. Ick.</li>
<li>Get dvd playback to work nicely. The easy solution is to go buy a video card with mpeg-2 decoding on it. Why does software decoding work so much nicer under Windows than Linux?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>It snowed this morning! In April! Crazyness!</p>

<p>I went out and bought a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2003-01-08">GBA SP</a> today. I love it. It's so tiny and beautiful. I also picked up Metroid Fusion, which is wonderfully old-school, yet beautiful. I hadn't had a gameboy since the first generation of them came out, back in the day. But I still have my old games (Tetris, Metroid II, Pinball, some others), which work on the GBA platform, even though the larger cartridges stick out a bit. Something fun to do on long bus rides.</p>

<p>If you use phoenix under linux, and you don't have anti-aliased fonts turned on, try <a href="http://phoenix.ragweed.net/download/">this</a>. I just installed it. It rocks.</p>
<p>No war coverage today. They had bloody golf on the tube. Golf! In this time of crisis.</p>
<p>I hiked around the arboretum for a while today. It was nice to be outside.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last night I had a dream that I was fighting zombies. <em>We rushed upstairs in the house where we were holed up, 'cause it's so easy for zombies to jump in through the downstairs windows. Now we only had a narrow staircase to defend. Luckilly it had a door at the top, too. The zombies were armed with derringers, so the usual thing that happened was that the zombies would shoot and miss, then we'd throw a heavy lamp at them and they's be knocked silly for a while but we couldn't steal their guns, cause they only had one shot. So we ended up having to hack the zombies up with a big knife or something. Eventually all of the people I was with were killed or zombiefied, and I was on the run. The funny thing about the whole thing was that neither I or the zombied had any special strength. In fact, they were kinda slow and easy to confuse.</em></p>
<p><em>Then I met the head zombie. He was slowly turning into an alien. His skin was becoming hard and scaly, and his fingers were becoming pointy, and his face was developing a beaklike structure. (Kind of like a Nivin Protector.) If this was a bad sci-fi movie, then there would be all of this scientific bullshit about space-born virus inteligence. But there wasn't, and that was refreshing. It helped that there was no know-it-all scientist character int he story at all.</em></p>
<p>Then I woke up.</p>
<hr />
<p>What did I do before that? I got home at 1am, made some dinner, and listened to the BBC World Service on FM90.7 for a while until they started talking about sports.</p>
<hr />
<p>What did I do before that? I went to see <a href="http://www.thekissers.com/">the Kissers</a> play at Luther's. Good show.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm thinking of doing the Appalachian Trail (or a portion thereof) this summer. This seems like it might be a logistical challenge.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today is St. Patrick's Day. Kyle says that the war would have started today, but for that fact. Someone in the administration probably noted that it would be unseemly for Al-Jazeera to broadcast images of Americans geting roaring drunk on Jameson's, Guinness, and Harp on the day that we start an invasion. Probably worse than when some Palestinean punks cheered September 11.</p>
<p>I kinda think Kyle is right. About the timing issue, that is.</p>
<p>I had planned to sponsor a debate on the war next week, assuming it hasn't started yet. It looks like it won't happen.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's spring today. It's time for me to switch to a lighter coat. That's too bad, 'cause I like my leather coat.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Site Update!</strong> (I wonder who reads this, anyway?)</p>
<p>I've been going back and rewriting the perl backend of this page. You shouldn't be able to tell a difference, but the code is a lot cleaner now. I've moved all of the reusable code into a <code>.pm</code> file so I can now knock out new cgi scripts much more quickly.</p>
<p>Yea! Reusable Code!</p>
<p>There's now a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041021021448/http://halcanary.org/blogsubmit.cgi">Blog Submission</a> form, which will only work if you are logged in.

I need a full sized USB keyboard that doesn't take up more space than it has to. Since I only have one USB port on my notebook, I also need a USB hub. The ideal thing would be a keyboard with a built in hub, like Apple has. So I wandered around CompUSA looking for such a thing. It turns out that half of the PC keyboards out there still have PS/2 connectors. And all of the rest are huge, with 20 unnessisary buttons.</p>
<p>So I ended up buying an Apple Pro Keyboard. It works perffectly. The only thing it lacks is a context-menu button. And the alt and start buttons are reversed. But I can deal with those issues. Apple could make a killing if they would market thier keyboards at PC users.</p>
<p>Yea! Hardware Standards!</p>

And this week I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007BH5C/theworldofhalcan">the soundtrack</a> while doing some christmas shopping. It's growing on me. If nothing else, download and listen to ‚ÄúGolumm's Song‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúBleg‚Äù is my favorite metasyntactic variable.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>New photos:</strong> from my trip to Ft. Meyers last week <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-11-29/">here</a> and <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-11-30/">here</a>. I also put up some photos from a trip to Devil's Lake on <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-11-02/">November 2</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone needs family in Florida.</p>
<p>After just getting back to town late this afternoon, I'm packing my bags for another trip early tomorrow morning. Pittsburgh on business. At least it's a direct flight. Let's check the <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=Pittsburgh">weather for Monday</a>: ‚ÄúCloudy. Scattered snow showers mainly afternoon. An inch or less of snow accumulation. Highs in the lower 30s. Southwest then 10 to 20 mph then west during the afternoon. Chance of snow 50 percent‚Äù. Fun.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why do I listen to jazz music? Funny story. I detested jazz music. Couldn't stand it. My father used to play the Memphis jazz station after finally giving up on commercial radio, but I hated it. Then some girl happened by my house, tagging along with one of my friends. She made the assumption that I liked jazz music, and started discussing the topic with me. I played along as if I cared, then immediately after, went out and started learning something about jazz. By the next month, I owned three Miles Davis albums. Just to impress some girl. Sounds like a bad sit-com episode. I was young and stupid then, now I'm old, stupid, and listen to jazz.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em> is not as good as the other <em>Law &amp; Orders</em>'s out there. It always ends the same way. The annoying, smart cop gets the criminal into the interrogation room and grilles them in a really scary, overacted way. The other cop says something every now and then. Eventually, the criminal confesses. It's usually the evil old lady who did it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Time to move on.</strong> I've given notice at work that I'll be leaving. My last day is the friday before Christmas. I'll be taking some classes at the UW next semester. Right now I'm thinking of taking Combinatorics (475) and the second semester of Analysis (522). Damnitall, Combinatorics is now closed. And I can't regester anytime soon. None of the classes I want to take have many open seats. On the other hand, seats will likely open up. They always do.</p>
<p>I plan on feeding myself through hiring myself out as a tutor. Good luck to me.</p>
<p>I'm excited about being a poor student again. I'm going to have to live on a strict budget. I've already made plans to write my own money-tracking software, like quicken, but without the bloat.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>My Vaio</strong> I've been playing around with my new notebook.</p>
<p>Still no linux.</p>
<p>I've finally gotten around to organizing the start menu. Why does the start menu have such awful organization by default? It doesn't matter, because I put shortcuts to the apps that I use on the top level anyways.</p>
<p>I've installed a bunch of software: cygwin, xfree86, gcc, two perl interpreters, a java jdk, two scheme interpreters, two versions of emacs, gpg, winamp, latex, xfig, gimp, Civilization 3, and the phoenix browser. Notice that I can do a large amount of development on this machine. To test out my complers and iterpreters, I've written ‚Äúhello world‚Äù in: c, c++, perl, java, python, scheme, and bash. So far, that's all of the development I've done. What I need now is a large digital library of reference books on the hard drive. I suppose that's what the www is for.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>To do</strong>: add a section to this site for code. Someone might be interested in my collection of hello worlds‚ÄîI guess not. Well, how about the code that runs this site? I guess that's pretty trivial. How about the java chat applet Mark and I did? What about that ftpcopy program? I suppose I'd have to finish development first. Never mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reading <em>This Modern World</em> (<a href="http://www.thismodernworld.com/pages/arc/arc_fr.html">archives</a>). It's funny how much history repeats itself over the course of 12 years. Of course, I spent the early nineties in a reactionary fog, so I don't remember much about them.</p>
<hr />
<p>I finished reading the <em>Quenta Silmarillion</em> again. It was better the second time. I'd like to see them take the story of T√∫rin Turambar and turn it into a movie. It's a great tragedy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's a link to the <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/"><em>Science Blog</em></a>. It's like slashdot, except that noone posts comments.</p>
<p>I'd also like to plug <a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> as a good source of general news. We don't need no stinkin' editors.</p>
<hr />

			<title>Vaio Notebook / Anarchy</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A fool and his money are soon parted. I, on the hand, felt that the economy needed stimulating. So I bought a new sub-notebook computer. It's a Sony VAIO PCG-SRX87 (not to be confused with a Swarny WOW). I meant to install linux on it as soon as possible, but soon gave up, seeing as the install program failed to recognize either my DVD drive or hard drive.</p>
<p>So instead, I installed a lot of cygwin stuff on top of XP. I'm using windowmaker on xfree86 on cygwin.</p>
<p>Now I have five different ways to connect to the internet from the notebook.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dialing in to my isp.</li>
<li>Dialing into work.</li>
<li>Wired ethernet to wherever.</li>
<li>Wireless ehternet where I can find it. (I've been moderately successful with this. Mark's house has wireless, it worked there. I've also found a signal at the Memorial Union, although I couldn't get the authentication to work. The other day, I found an open network from the stifskeller. I am tempted to chalk it, but that might be considered graphiti when you do it on the inside of a building. I think a better thing to do would be to get out my pocket knife and carve the warmark into the table. Then noone would notice. )</li>
<li>Wireless ethernet to connect to my desktop. Then ssh into the desktop, start the ppp conection remotely, and use X11 forwarding to run browser remotely.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>I started reading the <a href="http://www.diy-punk.org/anarchy/">Anarchy FAQ</a> the other day. In order for me to be an anarchist, someone is going to have to show me that a 100% anarchist society would work. On the other hand, I do believe that anarchy works in certain situations. I'd like to see the internet become even less organized. We shouldn't rely so much on DNS. <strong>DNS is not the internet.</strong></p>
<p>The reason I'm thinking about this is that I'd like to see someone organize a wireless cooperative in this city. The idea is to buy bandwidth in bulk and distribute it throughout the city using cheap wireless hardware.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fun links: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/wormer1011.html">one</a> and <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp1003.html">two</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>A while back I purchased a subscriotion to <a href="http://salon.com">Salon</a>. So far, I'm happy with it. It's better than most newspapers that I've ever subscribed to. Especially considering how much I hate killing trees just to print up boring sports scores or 14 hour old stock prices.</p>

<p>Here's a decent <a href="http://boingboing.net/">weblog</a>. This is really more of a reminder for me to bookmark it.</p>
<p>Today is columbus day. Do we really need this holiday anymore? However, it does make sense. It would be pretty hypocritical to have a ‚ÄúGee we're sorry, Native Americans, that we took away your land and killed most of you.‚Äù day. At least we're consistant.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Some cool things in my life:</p>
<ol>
<li>I heard Stephen Wolfram talk. That was much cheaper than buying his book. And I don't need another thick book to work on at the moment. I'm currently trying to get through Dostoevsky's <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. It has taken me a year to get through 15% of the book.</li>
<li>Last sunday I heard a live harpsichord performance of the first prelude &amp; fugue from <em>The Well-Tempered Klavier</em>. That was unexpected.</li>
<li>I finally got the broken seat in my car fixed. I am no longer driving a wreck-waiting-to-happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cool Factoid of the week: <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1901&amp;page=3">Owen Taylor says, <em>‚ÄúSupport for changing resolutions on the fly was just added to XFree86 CVS a couple of days ago.‚Äù</em></a></p>
<p>Inane Comment of the Week: <em>‚ÄúIf cloning is banned then only bans will have clones!‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Cool link of the week: <a href="http://www-bcs.mit.edu/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html">Checker Shadow Illusion</a>.</p>
<p>Coming soon: my review of Psyche.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For some years now, I've had crass commercialism hidden away on the <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/books">book</a> section of my site. Now I've moved it to the front page. Why, Hal, why?</p>
<ol>
<li>Every product that I encourage you to buy, I do so first because I think it's a good piece of art, and the artist deserves support.</li>
<li>This server costs me a few of dollars a month in rent, and the  domain name cost money, too. This is a better way to offset that cost  than banner ads (which are much more tacky).</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>More Linux news. (Skip to the next section if this bores you.)</p>
<p>RedHat is the distro I use at home, for good or bad. Mostly good. Since I got a job, I've occasionally supported them by buying shrink-wrapped products. I plan on continuing this practice. And I thank RedHat for making their iso's available for free to college kids with no money.</p>
<p>Anyway, RedHat Linux 8.0 came out this week. I tried 6.0 and 7.0 when they each came out, with mixed results. So I am inclined to wait until the bugs are sorted out, at least until 8.1.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of drawbacks to that plan. I'm going to miss out on the newest versions of several packages that I use. One thing I especially want is a newer version of Evolution, which I've begun using for IMAP mail recently. (I like Evolution's gpg support.)</p>
<p>The biggest thing introduced in 8.0 is antialiased fonts. Antialiased fonts in X11 make me salivate. I've been waiting for that day for over three years. <em>Over three years</em>.</p>
<p>Should I wait, or should I go for a bugfest with antialiased fonts? The more I think about this, the more I want to try out 8.0.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am against screen savers. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Any good GUI should automatically blank the screen after some amount of time. For instance, XFree86 can be set up with screen blanking using <em>xset</em>.</li>
<li>Most screen savers are no more interesting than flying toasters. Granted, some of the programs written for xscreensaver are cool, but even the coolest graphical hack gets old after so many repetitions.</li>
<li>They waste power. Lots of it. They keep the CPU sufficiently occupied that it can not go into power saving mode. And monitors are even worse.</li>
<li>I can't sleep with a screensaver bothering me.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This week is be nice to your car week. I've already taken part in the celebrations by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replacing the valve cover gasket that's been leaking oil for months.</li>
<li>Putting in new oil.</li>
<li>Replacing the fan belt that has been whining for the last 3000 miles.</li>
<li>Replacing the worn brake pads.</li>
<li>Taking it to the car wash, where the inside was vacuumed and cleaned.<br />
<em>Note that all of the above was performed by trained professionals. I wouldn't know what to do with a brake pad.</em></li>
<li>Ordered a replacement for the part of my seat that broke.<br />
<em>I will attempt to make this repair. Wish me luck.</em></li>
</ol>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I got the style preferences to work under IE6. I still don't know why it was crashing, though. The fix is a bit of a kludge.</p>
<p>Was bored this morning, so I went to church. They altered the prayers of the people. The new version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We pray that our leaders may govern with humility,<br />
that they not be full of selfish ambition or conceit...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old version (form I):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For our President, for the leaders of the nations,<br />
and for all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.<br />
Lord, have mercy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of the change. I think somebody's saying that our leaders are more evil today and that we no longer want the Lord to have mercy for them.</p>

			<title>Books on JavaScript and Perl</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend, I picked up a couple of O'Reilly books at the store: <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em> by David Flanagan, and <em>Programming Perl</em> (the camel book) by Larry Wall, et all.</p>
<p>I've found that JavaScript (js) is a much easier to grok if you think of it as a real language. And there's a lot of cool things that can be done with the W3C DOM.</p>
<p>Perl, on the other hand, is cool, but it's syntax is too complicated. A comparason is in order. YOu can learn all there is to know about Java's syntax in a short time, but it would take years of effort to lean everything that can be done with the language. With Perl, it takes a long time to grok the eccentricies of the syntax, but as soon as you do, you know how to do anything with the language.</p>
<p>Is there a word for this concept? I guess that Java is a minimalistic OOP language, while Perl is a maxamalistic language that allows OOP structures. As a logician, I hate Perl. As a hacker, I have a lot of respect for anyone who has mastered it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've played a bit with js and cookies. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021013042617/https://halcanary.org/preferences.cgi">the prefs page</a>.</p>
<p>I've been taking photos. See <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/a40/">this</a>, <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-08-25/">this</a>, and <a href="https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-08-31/">that</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Yeah! It finally shipped this week. It arrived on my chair yesterday, the 30th at 10:00am. That ruined my work day. All day I wanted to go home and plug it in. Here's my review:</p>
<p>I open the box, and take out all of the parts. It's small, but very heavy. Dense. Apple has packed a lot of stuff in this little stainless and plastic case. I was upset that I got fingerprints on the stainless back, but then I realized later why it's stainless: when writing to the drive or charging the battery, it gets rather hot. The device is beautiful. It fits in your pocket. Once you get a hang of the scrollwheel, it's the easiest interface on a device of that type I've ever seen.</p>
<p>I get it home, and plug it in. Damn, it's just as I suspected: that cheap firewire card I got from newegg is broken. Out to best buy: $80 for a firewire card. No way. On to CompUSA. 30 USD for a card. I take it home and plug it in to that archaic PCI bus. It works! NT 5.1 sees it. After installing the iPod software (which sucks. Apple went to a third party for thier windows mp3 player/playlist manager) I start the upload. 4Gb takes a while, even at frewire speeds. But at least it's not USB 1.1, like my camera. (Did I mention my digital camera here? See <a href="http://ups.physics.wisc.edu/~hal/powershot.html">this</a>.)</p>
<p>Then i start playing it. No, it doesn't make any music sound any better. But it is really reliable, unlike the mp3-playing cd player I have. And it fits in my pocket. And the remote on the cord is perfect and easy-to-use.</p>
<p>I'll quickly mention how to use it as an external hard drive. Plug it in, and a dialog should pop up asking if you want to sync. Don't touch the dialogue, and look at &quot;My computer&quot; (I hate windows. I never feel stupid telling people about /dev/hdb7 or /usr/local/bin.) Your iPod should be there as a new hard drive.</p>
<p>Will someone tell me the state of firewire support in linux? I know about the /etc/hotplug/ieee1394.agent file and I've got hotplugging workign with my usb camera. I just want to mount it as an external harddrive.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've switched from KDE back to WindowMaker. The 'maker is still faster, and I don't need any of KDE's &quot;advanced&quot; features. But when I made my parents use linux (evil grin), I set the default to KDE, and they were happy. And they like KDE's games.</p>
<p>No, I haven't convinced them to get linux+X11+KDE. But I might have finally convinced my father to upgrade from windows 95 to NT 5.x on his home machine. Especially since MS doesn't support 95 anymore. He'll probaly have to get a faster processor, though.</p>
<p>Here's my spectrum of OS goodness:</p>
<p>DOS &lt; MacOS &lt; Windows95,98,ME &lt; NT,2k,XP &lt; other unixes &lt; OSX &lt; linux.</p>
<p>I just want my parents to move further to the right than they are now.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The last two books I read, <em>Fallen Dragon</em>, by Peter F. Hamilton and <em>Survivor</em>, by Chuck Palhaniuk have a few things in common.</p>
<p>I read both in one sitting. This seems to be the only way for me to apprach anything these days. If I can't finish it in one go, it gets put aside as soon as I seen another shiny thing.</p>
<p>The protaganists in each book are programmed to behave in ways that benefit their families, but each finds a way to break out. Lawrence Newton travels back in time to help himself run away from home; Tender Branson does not kill himself, and later his twin brother tries to break the rest of his programming.</p>
<p>Both get involved with evil corporations once they enter the real world: Newton becomes a corporate space pirate, and Branson becomes a TV evangelist.</p>
<p>And there's the theme of the transforming nature of sex. Both Newton's father and Branson's brother try to use sex to change them.</p>
<p><strong>Coincidence, or special sauce?</strong></p>
<p>I could turn this into a nice three paragraph essay, suitable for a 10th grade english class, but I won't.</p>

<p>Spending more money on CD's.</p>
<p>Got these nifty thumb screws for my computer. They are the same size as the srews that you use to keep the covers on the case, but they have an oversized thumb knob to make access easier. For the first time in months, my case covers are screwed on!</p>
<p>As of last weekend, I've been graduated for exactly one year. Crazy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've installed RedHat 7.3. Everything works well. My review:</p>
<p>Gnome 1.6 - sucks.</p>
<p>KDE3 - Works well. I haven't yet decided between KDE3 and WindowMaker for my window manager/desktop environment. KDE's fonts are okay. And their font installer app rocks.</p>
<p>Ximian Evolution - I got it to sync with my palm!</p>
<p>Konq - As a browser, it sucks. As a file manager, it's okay (not that I need a file manager). It seems to be on par with Nautilus.</p>
<p>KDE Console. - It's got tabbed windows. I like this a lot. I'd like it more if I knew what keyboard shortcut moves between tabs.</p>
<p>The evil noises in KDE when you mess with windows. - I turned that shit off.</p>
<p>KDE's mp3 player - okay, once I leaned how set up the playlist. I've gotten sick of xmms's crappy fonts.</p>
<p>Connecting to the internet. &quot;rp3 -i ppp0&quot; (the gui option) or &quot;alias u '/sbin/ifup ppp0'&quot; (the CLI option). Should I forget my old-fashoned fASCIIst ways and go the way of the point and click? I don't know.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, I don't _want_ people using Linux for ideological reasons. I think ideology sucks. This world would be a much better place if people had less ideology, and a whole lot more &quot;I do this because it's FUN and because others might find it useful, not because I got religion&quot;.</p>

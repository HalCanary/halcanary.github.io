gphoto2 grabs images off of my camera and saves it as IMG\_XXXX.JPG. I use the [despacify script](/archives/000073.html) to convert to lowercase img\_XXXX.jpg. Then I run this script to rename th file to include the date the photo was taken: 2003-11-06-img-XXXX.jpg. Then if the filesystem modification date is changed (e.g. if I rotate it.) I will still know when it originated.

    
    #!/bin/sh
    ## $HOME/bin/rename-files ##
    for FILE in img_????.jpg ; do
        X=( `stat  -c %y $FILE ` )
        DATE=${X[0]}
        mv -v "$FILE" "$DATE-$FILE"
    done

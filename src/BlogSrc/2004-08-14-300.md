I have a 109-key Apple Pro Keyboard. This is my current .Xmodmap file:

    
    ! xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap
    
    !! Funny Apple Keys:
    keycode 174 = F16
    keycode 176 = F17
    keycode 160 = F18
    keycode 204 = F19
    
    !! Why are these different on Apple Keyboard?
    keycode 157 = KP_Equal
    keycode 182 = Print
    keycode 183 = Scroll_Lock
    keycode 184 = Pause
    
    !! Remove Caps_Lock
    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
    keycode 66 = F20

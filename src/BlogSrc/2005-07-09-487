<blockquote><p>Many analysts have noted the transformation of Al Qaeda from an organization to a movement---that is, from a top-down, centrally directed terrorist group to a decentralized "franchise" operation, in which local operators like Abu Zarqawi and the Madrid bombers make their own plans and pursue their own tactical objectives.</p>
<p>John Robb, the systems analyst behind the blog <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2005/07/journal__a_caut.html">Global Guerrillas</a>, argues that this evolution may actually have <em>improved</em> Al Qaeda's long-term survivability and operational effectiveness, even if it rules out large, complex attacks like 9/11. A highly decentralized network of terrorist cells, he argues, can use something analogous to market mechanisms to coordinate its actions---learning to avoid the mistakes and imitate the successes of other cells.</p>
<p>If true, it could mark the birth of an entirely new type of conflict---a "fifth generation" warfare in which the enemy not only isn't a nation state, but isn't even an <em>entity</em> — like the Viet Cong or the Shining Path or the PLO. It's almost impossible to imagine how a security establishment that yet hasn't learned how to fight a fourth generation insurgency is going to cope with that.</p>

<blockquote><p>The franchise and the virus work on the same principle: what thrives in one place with thrive in another. You just have to find a sufficiently virulent business plan, condense it into a three-ring binder - its DNA - xerox it, and embed it in the fertile lining of a well-traveled highway, preferably one with a left-turn lane. Then the growth will expand until it runs up against its property lines.</p>
<p> — NS (<a href="/isbn/?0553380958">source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>If Terror is now nothing more than a franchise---anyone with a high school education, access to a public library (you don't even need to check books out), and a grudge can start a cell---then we need to rethink how we deal with it.  How do you deal with spoiled brats who throw tantrums?  Ignore them.</p>
<p>What do these kids want?  (1) They want to be on TV.  (2) They want you to be afraid of them.</p>

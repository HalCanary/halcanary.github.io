<p>The number of Iraqi civilians killed in the war is somewhere between <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">15,289</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4076993.stm">100,000</a>. Good to see that we have a number that's at most off by one order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Apoligists for the war would say that the true number is somewhere on the low end.  I'd like to see GWB in front of a war crimes tribunal:</p>
<p>"But, your honor, we only killed <em>fifteen thousand</em> inocent civilians, not that other number!"</p>

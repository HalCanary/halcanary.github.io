<p>I really think a computer should last more than 32 months.  Sloop, the computer I built in June 2008, failed yesterday.  Coincidentally, I ripped the old HDDs out of Dalek the day before to send it to be recycled.  Now I have two old boxes to recycle.</p>
<p>I bought a cheap desktop at the store yesterday and didn&#0039;t even try to look for a good deal online.  I just wanted to have a functioning computer.  The new case is 34% smaller by volume (I just measured).  I would have gotten something even smaller, but I wanted a t least one PCI slot, one PCI Express slot, and room to mount my old HDD.  I named it Occam.</p>
<p>Occam is a Dell.  The CPU is a Intel Pentium Dual&#0045;Core E5800.  One benchmark rates this as 34% faster than Sloop&#0039;s Athlon 64 X2 6000+, which was an upgrade 18 months ago. </p>

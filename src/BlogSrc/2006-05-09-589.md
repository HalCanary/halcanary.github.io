This is me the day I moved to Madison:

When I finally move away, will I look like that again?

\* \* \*

For my upcoming move this summer, I'll be putting a portion of my possessions in storage. After hearing horror stories of people losing many books and papers to water damage, the plan is to line each box with a large garbage bag before filling it up. This way if there is flood damage, I won't lose everything.

Every possession of mine that I can't throw out will be hermetically sealed into boxes lined with garbage bags.

Everything that I don't need in the next six months goes into a storage unit while I figure out my long-term living situation. As I pack books into box after box, I have this feeling that I might not open these boxes for decades.

Sort of like my own personal time capsule. Cool.

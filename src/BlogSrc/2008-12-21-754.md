**UPDATE 2009-01-04**: Just as I suspected, that code is highly inefficient. Here's a different algorithm which is much faster for large N.

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # randomize_list.py
    # Written 2008-2009 Hal Canary
    # Dedicated to the public domain.
    import sys, random
    l=[]
    for line in sys.stdin:
    	l.append(line)
    while l:
    	i = random.randint(0,len(l)-1)
    	sys.stdout.write(l.pop(i))

Testing with the `time` command showed a 74% reduction in CPU use with the better algorithm.

<p>The iMac G5 is incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>Nobody wants an all-in-one desktop.  If they did, they'd just buy a  iBook, and plug in an usb keyboard.</p>
<p>Look at the Mac product line.  There is a big gaping hole in the  low-end desktop.  Take the current G5 iMac and remove the 17-inch  LCD screen.  </p>
<pre>
G5 iMac - 17 inch Apple LCD screen
  = $1299 - $699
  = $600</pre>
<p>They could sell a $600 computer without monitor!  Then Joe Consumer would just plug in his old CRT and have a decent consumer PC.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yes, I know it would end up costing closer to $800.  But still, can't anyone get ahold of a monitor easily?</p>

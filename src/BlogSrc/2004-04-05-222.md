I figured this out after reading HP's [essay on useability](http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html), where he mentions that “Emacs is basically the last remaining X application that insists on having cut and paste that doesn't work correctly.”

A while back, I vowed to switch from emacs to another editor. Silly me. That could never happen.

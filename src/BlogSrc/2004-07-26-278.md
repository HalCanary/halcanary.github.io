I've been getting attacks against my sshd server:

    
    Failed logins from these:
       admin/password from 12.47.62.139: 2 Time(s)
       admin/password from 134.21.2.227: 2 Time(s)

If you have one of these common accounts, shut off logins from them:

    
    ## lines added to /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PermitRootLogin no
    DenyUsers admin guest test user
    ## EOF

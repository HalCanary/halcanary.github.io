Spent a load of money on my car today. Battery, belt, & oil. It's probably all worth it.

I've also decided to reread [“Oceans Unmoving”](http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=050124) because it made no sense the first time through. It's a good self-contained story. (I'm assuming that it will end in the next week or so.) It reads better as _comic book_ than as a _daily comic strip_. The author would also benefit from more editorial input.

This weekend, I watched the first series of [_The IT Crowd_](http://www.torrentspy.com/directory/977/tv/it+crowd+%28the%29). Some of it was brilliant, and some of it was less so. The first episode is my current favorite.

I believe that every TV show should have limited runs. Tell your story, do a handful of variations on your theme, then end it. Bringing back _Family Guy_ was probly a mistake; the new episodes don't add much. That said, there are no hard-and-fast rules on how many episodes is enough. _FMA_ tells a single story in fifty-one episodes. Most sitcoms should be ended after a dozen episodes.

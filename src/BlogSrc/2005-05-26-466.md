**WARNING:** Metablogging is always stupid. Do not continue reading this post.

Reasons to contiue using movable type:

1.  Already installed and working
2.  Does everything I want it to.
3.  Like its template system.

Reasons to dump movable type:

1.  Free as in beer (v2.64), not as in speech.
2.  Version 2.x no longer supported. Version 3.x not free. (I fell for the BitKeeper Trap!)
3.  Comment Spam issue.
4.  Do I really need a forsaken database? It complicates backup. I'd rather have a load of flat files tied together with php scripts.

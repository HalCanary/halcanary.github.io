I've got out of the need-to-install-a-new-OS-all-the-time mode. This is mostly because Linux Distributions these days are mostly good enough.

So I've got Ubuntu [8.04](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Ubuntu_releases#Ubuntu_8.04_.28Hardy_Heron.29) (Hardy Heron) installed. Since this is a "Long Term Support" release, I'll leave it installed until the next LTS release or until it end-of-lifes.

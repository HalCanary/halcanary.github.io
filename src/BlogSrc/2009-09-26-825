<p>What to do with this info?  first of all, print out the fingerprints and put them in your wallet.</p>
<p>Here's another thing I do:</p>
<pre>ssh-show-key-fingerprint | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/issue.ssh > /dev/null
echo 'Banner /etc/issue.ssh' | \
  sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config > /dev/null</pre>
<p>This, of course, is in no way a secure way to check your fingerprint, since it is just as vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.  But it works as a backup plan.</p>
<p>And some legal theories say you should insert these additional lines into your /ets/issue.ssh file:</p>

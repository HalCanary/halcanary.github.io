Vacation Day Three.

Yesterday, we took the ferry down to Key West. In restrospect, this was a bad idea. Thre and a half hours each way, compared to spending five hours on the island.

The water was choppy. I spent the trip back emptying my stomach into a sequence of small bags.

I think I still have hydrocloric acid in my sinuses.

The key lime pie was no better in the keys than anywhere else.

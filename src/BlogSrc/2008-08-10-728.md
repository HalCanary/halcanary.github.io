People ask what I eat. Here it is:

**The Diet:**

_Breakfast_  
• 1 quart of iced tea, prepared the night before and allowed to cool to room temperature before adding ice. (I like to start the day hydrated.)  
• 1 cup Uncle Sam Cereal, served with non-fat milk, berries (straw-, black-, rasp-, or blue-), and 1 packet of sucralose.

_Lunch_  
• Salad, prepared before work: Spinach or lettuce, cubed smoked turkey lunch-meat, cheese (reduced-fat feta, cheddar, or blue), nuts (pecans, almond slices, sunflower kernels, or peanuts), sometimes berries, and home-made vinaigrette.  
• 1/2 cup unsalted peanuts, mixed with half a box of raisins. (I sometimes make this my mid-morning snack, if I have an opportunity.)  
• Two reduced-fat low-moisture Mozzarella string cheese sticks.  
• 1 quart of iced tea, left over from breakfast.

_Mid-afternoon Snack_  
• 1/2 cup unsalted peanuts, mixed with the other half of the box of raisins.  
• Water.

_Dinner_  
• An identical salad, prepared with lunch that morning.  
• Water  
• 2 cups of low-cal yogurt (if I'm still hungry).

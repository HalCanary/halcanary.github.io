<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/"> <img src="/images/gnu-radio.png" width="203" height="117" alt="[GNU RADIO]" /></a> I read this  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,994679,00.html"> article on software defined radio</a> and once again got excited about  it. The only problem is that you need a very expensive ADC to pick up  <a href="http://comsec.com/wiki?HowtoHdTv">FM or HDTV</a>. </p>
<p>If software defined radio ever becomes really common, maybe the price of the hardware will drop. It seems to me that an ADC is such a horribly useful piece of equipment that every computer should come with one.  It's refreashing to see that the free software sommunity is  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/">so far ahead in this game</a>.</p>
<p>If anyone I know has an old ADC card laying about and wants to work on building something cool, tell me.</p>

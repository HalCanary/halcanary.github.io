Got the jeep back from the shop today. The oil pressure switch had a leak, and the dripping oil had damaged the starter. Both had to be replaced.

I've decided that westside Madison was designed to make bus transport inefficient and time-consuming. I'm glad to have my car back.

J&C, I owe you each a beer for driving me around.

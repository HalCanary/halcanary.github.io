For my birthday, the folks gave me a [radio with built-in dynamo](http://www.etoncorp.co.uk/fr250.html). I've wanted one of these for years. 90 seconds of cranking is supposed to provide an hour of music.

One can also charge a cellphone with the dynamo. But not _my_ cell phone, because every cell phone uses a unique connector.

<p>&ldquo;No way I'm calling anyone &lsquo;Father&rsquo; or &lsquo;Your Holiness&rsquo; unless they are, in fact, my father or made of Swiss cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should always call people what they wish to be called...I get to choose what you call me.&rdquo; ---</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but in some cases, isn't that tacitly agreeing to participate in a political system you may find distateful? Why should Prince Harry get treated to more fawning nomenclature (&lsquo;Your Royal Highness...&rsquo;) than Rosa Parks?&rdquo;</p>

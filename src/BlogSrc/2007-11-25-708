Was reading Gwyneth Cravens' _Power to Save the World: The Truth about Nuclear Energy_ (ISBN 9780307266569) and ran across a couple of interesting things.

Smokers are significantly more likely to absorb radon gas into their lungs than non-smokers. (Radon can be found in uranium mines, but can easily be flushed out with better ventilation.)

And I like this quote from Rip Anderson:

> "A nuclear plant that emitted as much radiation as a coal-fired plant would be shut down."

I'm still only 50 pages into the book. It's a lot of basic science that I learned in high school, combined with a lot of facts I didn't know, written by an author who started learning the subject from a state of total ignorance.

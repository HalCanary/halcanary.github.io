<p>I just read Stephen Baxter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345430786/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>Manifold Space</em></a>. I picked it up on the theory that it wouldn't be as depressing as Baxter's other novels. I'm not sure why I expected that. The ending was just as just as morbid as the others. Plot summary: life sucks, then you have depressing adventures in space, then you die, then the human race becomes extinct, then the universe is destroyed.</p>
<p>It's the anti-startrek.</p>

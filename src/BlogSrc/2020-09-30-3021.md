SUMMARY=adding dark mode to this site.

I added a `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {...}` block to this site's CSS. The tough part was to make the SVG fill color respect that.  But it turns out that if you just style the svg element with
```
svg {
    fill: currentColor;    
}
```
and remove all style information in the SVG itself, then it works as expected.

<p>I loaned someone my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201549913/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>Data Structures &amp; Problem Solving Using Java</em></a> by Mark Weiss a while back.  I forgot who, and I want the book back.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  It would appear that Chris Wilson has it.</p>

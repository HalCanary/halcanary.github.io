I've been using Fedora Linux on six computers I'm responsible for. I like it a lot. Here's why:

1.  The project is becoming more open. All of the how-to-hack-the-system info that RedHat never published is being provided bu the community now.
2.  More and more third-party rpms are being made availible. Quality is improving.

If you have a FC1 system, you really should go to:

*   [fedora.redhat.com.](http://fedora.redhat.com/)
*   [The Unofficial Fedora FAQ](http://fedora.artoo.net/faq/): info on setting up yum repositorys (hint: use the mirror.kernel.org mirror), info on installing java jdk or sdk correctly. Maintained by Max Kanat-Alexander.
*   [FedoraNews](http://fedoranews.org/): news from the fedora-list mailing list, beginner hints, building RPM packages for your system. Maintained by Thomas Chung.

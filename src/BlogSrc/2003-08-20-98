<p>I'm reading <em>Komarr</em> by Lois Bujold. It's another one of her space operas, but this one is seriously lacking in spaceships so far. </p>
<p>I don't know how I'm going to fix my sleep schedule so that I can attend 8:30 classes. I might have to resort to coffee. I wonder how old those coffee beans are? I bought them when I lived on Vilas.  I really haven't drunk much coffee since I was an undergrad. Do coffee beans get stale?</p>

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#DTPD#
## ~/bin/wgeto ##
exec wget -o /dev/null -O - "$@"
```

Then,

```
$ wgeto http://craphound.com/ebooksneitherenorbooks.txt \
   | fold -s -w 70 | less 
```

Explanation for non-unix-literate people: First of all, I wrote a neat script
called `wgeto`. `wget` is a program that downloads stuff off of the internet, via
http or ftp. wgeto calls wget, but tells it to ignore the progress dialog by
sending it to the null device, "-o /dev/null". (See Rule of Silence from
[_The Art of Unix Programming_](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2878450).)
`wgeto` then pipes the document into standard output.

I pipe it through fold to wrap long lines

Then I pipe it into a pager, less, so that I can page through the document.

Now I don't have to save a copy on the hard disk.

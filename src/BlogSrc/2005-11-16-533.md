I just read Stephen Baxter's [_Manifold Space_](/isbn/?0345430786). I picked it up on the theory that it wouldn't be as depressing as Baxter's other novels. I'm not sure why I expected that. The ending was just as just as morbid as the others. Plot summary: life sucks, then you have depressing adventures in space, then you die, then the human race becomes extinct, then the universe is destroyed.

It's the anti-startrek.

![[cover]](/images/59d31006a098d64eed390372990c46b758712e82.jpg)_The City & The City_ by China Mi√©ville ([034549752X](/isbn/?034549752X/The+City+and+The+City)). At first I had trouble suspending disbelief on the premise, but the book was so well written that the suspension happened anyway. How? The author stuck to the premise perfectly, creating a perfectly self-consistant world. I was somewhat upset that even though most of the mysteries of the book were resolved in the final act, the wierd history was never really explained.  

![[cover]](/images/e9a67ac5359668de48212d58d795a39e2b17cd04.jpg)When I was looking for downloadable audiobooks from the public library, I checked out the audio version of _The Great Gatsby_ by F. Scott Fitzgerald ([0743273567](/isbn/?0743273567/The+Great+Gatsby)), and read by Alexander Scourby ([1602834725](https://halcanary.org/isbn/?1602834725/The+Great+Gatsby+Audio)). I'm glad I finally got around to this one; I keep telling myself that I'll read all the classics of American literature, but I never did, until I got started on the idea of listening to audiobooks while bicycling.

How to install the Fedora Core 4 version of the default Clearlooks theme on Fedora Core 5 and later:

![SCREENSHOT OF THEME](/images/Clearlooks_FC4_example.png)

Begin by going to [http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/](http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/) and find a mirror. Navigate to the directory `core/4/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/` to download the two rpm packages we need: gnome-themes-x.xx.x-x.xxx.rpm and gtk2-engines-x.x.x-x.xxxx.rpm

    mkdir workingfolder
    cd workingfolder
    rpm2cpio [PATH]/gnome-themes-2.10.1-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
    rpm2cpio [PATH]/gtk2-engines-2.6.3-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
    cp -a usr/share/themes/Clearlooks Clearlooks_FC4

Now we need to edit the files in the Clearlooks\_FC4 directory to give this theme a new name so the Theme Manager doesn't get confused. Edit the file `Clearlooks_FC4/index.theme`:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Clearlooks_FC4
    Type=X-GNOME-Metatheme
    Comment=Attractive Usability
    Encoding=UTF-8
    
    [X-GNOME-Metatheme]
    GtkTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
    MetacityTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
    IconTheme=Clearlooks

Edit the file `Clearlooks_FC4/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml` and change one line:

    <name>Clearlooks_FC4</name>

Now let's wrap this up:

    mkdir -p ~/.themes
    mv Clearlooks_FC4 ~/.themes
    cd ..
    rm -r workingfolder
    gnome-theme-manager &

Or you could just download my copy of [Clearlooks\_FC4.tar.gz](/pub/Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz).

    mkdir -p ~/.themes
    tar xzf Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz -C ~/.themes/
    gnome-theme-manager &

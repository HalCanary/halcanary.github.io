<p>I'm publishing this address, in this form:</p>
<p>mailto: test at halcanary dot org</p>
<p>on this page as a test of spam email harvesters.  This seems like the simplest way to spam-armor an email address.  So far I've got no spam at that address since I put the address up on May 21.</p>
<p>This is encouraging.  I should be able to switch to another address for all of my personal communication and, as long as I don't use it for mailing lists, usenet, or www forums, it should remain hidden from spammers.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> Still no spam at that address.  Cool!</p>

<p><em>Shavegeek</em> is an actual term, not invented by me.  It refers to those guys who look down on Gillette Mach3 and Schick Quattro users like Unix hackers look down on Microsoft Windows users.</p>
<p>The shavegeeks recommend (please note that shavegeeks, like all geeks, will argue the pros and cons of any aspect of shaving: they don't speak with 100% unanimity.)  using a bristle brush and shaving soap or cream and either a straight razor or double-edge safety razor.</p>
<p>My shaving routine for the past few years---since I grew out the beard on my cheeks as well as chin---has been to shave my neck every morning in the shower with ivory soap and a cartridge razor.  My main gripe was the expense of the cartridge---each one cost more than a dollar, and are getting more expensive with each new upgrade.  So I bought a <a href="http://www.classicshaving.com/catalog/item/522941/284057.htm">Merkur HD</a> double-edge razor.  I can find a stack of 10 DE blades at the local grocery store for about $2.75. </p>
<p>At the same time, I ordered a bristle brush and shaving soap.  For several days I tried shaving in front of a mirror again, but I didn't like it.  First of all, I am now used to feeling around my face instead of looking at it.  Secondly, as hot as hot lather can be, it is never the same as standing inside a steamy shower; my skin knows the difference.  Finally, cleanup is more complicated when I'm already out of the shower.  I need to wash bits of soapy lather out of my beard and wash off my face.</p>
<p>So I'm now using the DE razor in the shower.  The big difference between a modern cartridge razor and a DE is that the cartridge is on springs that allow it to keep the right angle on your face.  With the DE, I need to continually be mindful of the right angle.  Of course it's a <em>safety</em> razor, so when the angle is wrong, it simply doesn't shave.  </p>
<p>Plus it's just a beautiful piece of equipment.  Mechanically simple.  Inexpensive blades.  Durable.  Made out of steel.  Doesn't fall apart when you drop it on the floor.</p>

<p>I don't desire baby-smooth skin, which most shavegeeks go for.  The closer your shave is, the more irritation you will get.  So I shave in either one or two passes.  The first pass is with the grain and the second pass is perpendicular to the first.  I usually completely forgo the final against-the-grain pass that many shavegeeks seem to love.  When I am in a hurry I might even skip the second pass, too.</p>

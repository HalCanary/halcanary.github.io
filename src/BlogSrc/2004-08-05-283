<p>I picked up Doom3 yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>technical</strong>.  It plays well at 1024x768 on my  Radeon 9200 (with the proper drivers).  This makes me happy. I need 5.1 speakers for my computer to get the full effect, but the sound works well in stereo.</p>
<p>  <strong>linux</strong>. Linux binaries have not yet been   released.  In the mean time, I have been banished to   windows-land.  Poor me.</p>
<p>  <strong>suspense</strong>. That's what the game is all about   isn't it?  Doom3 has got suspense.  A lot of the skill   is learning that if zombies don't have guns, they can't  shoot you.  Keep your flashlight on them untill they   are five feet away from you.  Then pull out your   shotgun and shoot at where you last saw them.   Demons, on the other hand, move quickly and can't   be killed with a single blast.  Shoot them until they   die.  But knowing how to use the flashlight is   important.</p>
<p>  <strong>graphics</strong>.  What can I say?  No screenshot can do the overall effect  justice, because the cinamatography is so subtle.  It's like Id realized the limitations of the graphics and designed a game to emphasize the strengths of the engine and not the weaknesses.  (<a href="/p/doom">screenshots</a>)</p>

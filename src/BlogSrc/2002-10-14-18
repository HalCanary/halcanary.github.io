<p><img src="/images/alice-small2.png" alt="[little alice]" width="76" height="254" /> This image on the left is just me playing around with the gimp and my digital camera. Nothing all that cool. All the same, I'm happy with the way she looks. </p>
<p>Here's a decent <a href="http://boingboing.net/">weblog</a>. This is really more of a reminder for me to bookmark it. </p>
<p>Today is columbus day. Do we really need this holiday anymore? However, it does make sense. It would be pretty hypocritical to have a &ldquo;Gee we're sorry, Native Americans, that we took away your land and killed most of you.&rdquo; day. At least we're consistant.</p>

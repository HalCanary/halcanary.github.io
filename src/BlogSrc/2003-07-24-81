I've been working on this for a while now. I'd like to produce a .emacs file that will completely remap the keybindings to [some kind of standard](http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/userinput.html#standard-shortcuts).

The biggest problem seems to be the ctrl-x and ctrl-c behavior.

[To those in the emacs community who say that the default behavior is superior](http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2003-02/msg00652.html), I won't disagree. But ctrl-f is search in my browser, and whenever I hit ctrl-s to search, it tries to save the web page. So I figured I needed to retrain myself and emacs to a single standard.

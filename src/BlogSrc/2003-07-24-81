<p>Code from <a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2003-02/msg00652.html">This message</a></p>
<p>I've been working on this for a while now. I'd like to produce a .emacs file that will completely remap the keybindings to <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/userinput.html#standard-shortcuts"> some kind of standard</a>. </p>
<p>The biggest problem seems to be the ctrl-x and ctrl-c behavior. </p>
<p><a href="http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2003-02/msg00652.html"> To those in the emacs community who say that the default behavior is superior</a>, I won't disagree. But ctrl-f is search in my browser, and whenever I hit ctrl-s to search, it tries to save the web page. So I figured I needed to retrain myself and emacs to a single standard.</p>

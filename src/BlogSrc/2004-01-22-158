<p>The first computer that was <em>mine</em> and not shared with my family was dave, a gateway P2-233 that my grandmother bought me in 1997.  Last week I permanently retired it from its duties as a web server.  Last night I salvaged the last bit of useful hardware off of him:  a pair of thumbscrews.</p>

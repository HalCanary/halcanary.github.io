Neal Stephenson is obsessed with money. I'm reading  
[_the Confusion_](/isbn/?0060523867) right now, and as always, Eliza is trying to figure out _what_ money is in order to learn _how_ to get more of it.

It's one of those subjects that I just don't get. What exactly backs a US Federal Reserve Note?  
I still can't figure that one out.

Originlly, the dollar was 24.06 g Ag or 1.60 g Au.  
Then it was 1.5 g Au. Then 0.89 g Au. Then 0.82 g Au.  
Now it's a piece of paper that can be taken to the loacal tavern and traded for alcohol. Good enough for me, I suppose.

**UPDATE 2004-08-11:** Also note that the ratio of the dime to quarter is 10/25. Why? They were both originally siver coins, like the dollar itself. They were worth exactly thier weight in silver.

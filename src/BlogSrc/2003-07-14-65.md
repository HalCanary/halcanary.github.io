[![[GNU RADIO]](/images/gnu-radio.png)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/) I read this [article on software defined radio](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,994679,00.html) and once again got excited about it. The only problem is that you need a very expensive ADC to pick up [FM or HDTV](http://comsec.com/wiki?HowtoHdTv).

If software defined radio ever becomes really common, maybe the price of the hardware will drop. It seems to me that an ADC is such a horribly useful piece of equipment that every computer should come with one. It's refreashing to see that the free software sommunity is [so far ahead in this game](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio/).

If anyone I know has an old ADC card laying about and wants to work on building something cool, tell me.

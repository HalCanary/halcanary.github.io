<p>I work best when I wake up at the same time every morning.  Since I  have an 8:00 am class two days a week, that has been pushed up to  6:00 am.  Since I stayed home on a friday night last lingt, I  suddenly find myself up at 6:13 on a Saturday morning. And here I  thought <em>Weekend Edition</em> began before 7:00 on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Well, nothing to do but continue cleaning my apartment and doing  homework.</p>

I work best when I wake up at the same time every morning. Since I have an 8:00 am class two days a week, that has been pushed up to 6:00 am. Since I stayed home on a friday night last lingt, I suddenly find myself up at 6:13 on a Saturday morning. And here I thought _Weekend Edition_ began before 7:00 on Saturdays.

Well, nothing to do but continue cleaning my apartment and doing homework.

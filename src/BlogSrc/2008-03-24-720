<p>Saw today that <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> &ldquo;Razor&rdquo; was nominated for the 2008 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.  I wouldn't call a 104 minute film "short," even if the abridged version premired on TV before it was released on DVD.  I also noticed that I still hadn't watched it, even though the Netflix DVD was sitting on my desk.</p>
<p>So I watched it.  Four nested flashbacks.  Yeah, I'd vote for it, were I a voter.  Although I did like &ldquo;Blink.&rdquo;</p>

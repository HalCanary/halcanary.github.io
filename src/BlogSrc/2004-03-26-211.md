[Processor\_](http://magnatune.com/artists/processor)'s _Insomia_ rocks. It's electronica with just enough variation-on-a-theme so that it doesn't suffer from excessive repetition. It makes good use of sampled voices (e.g. MLK, which is a bit of a clich√©).

Is it original? Not at all. I swear I've heard the title track before. But does that really matter? Not at all.

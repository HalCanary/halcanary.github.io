<p>To users of the phoenix browser: I found this page on <a href="http://texturizer.net/phoenix/">Phoenix Help</a>.</p>
<p>If you use phoenix under linux, and you don't have anti-aliased fonts turned on, try <a href="http://phoenix.ragweed.net/download/">this</a>. I just installed it. It rocks.</p>
<p>No war coverage today. They had bloody golf on the tube. Golf! In this time of crisis.</p>
<p>I hiked around the arboretum for a while today. It was nice to be outside.</p>

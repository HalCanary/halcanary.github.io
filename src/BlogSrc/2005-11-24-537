<p>Vacation Day Three.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we took the ferry down to Key West. In restrospect, this was a bad idea. Thre and a half hours each way, compared to spending five hours on the island.</p>
<p>The water was choppy.  I spent the trip back emptying my stomach into a sequence of small bags.</p>
<p>I think I still have hydrocloric acid in my sinuses.</p>
<p>The key lime pie was no better in the keys than anywhere else.</p>

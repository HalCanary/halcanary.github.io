<p>Happy Solstice!  At 7-something (CST) this morining, the north pole pointed as far away from Sol as gets.</p>
<p>And it snowed last night.  I've been looking out my window every morning, checking for snow, wondering when it will finally stick to the ground.  No more waiting.</p>
<p>And I expct a blizzard the day I get back to Madison from FL.  That would be the 30th.  You can go ahead and mark your calendars.  There is <strong>always</strong> a snowstorm whenever I travel northwards in wintertime.</p>

**New movies I want to see:**

_A Scanner Darkly_ — I am not a big PKD fan, but I have never failed to enjoy a Philip K. Dick movie adaption (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck).

_Clerks II_ — Guilty pleasure. I can probably wait for this to come out on DVD, but if I get bored, I might catch it in the theater.

_My Super Ex-Girlfriend_ — This looks bad, but it might be good.

**Movies I've seen so far this summer:**

_X-Men 3_ — The new director did not do nearly as badly as he could have done.

_An Inconvenient Truth_ — Definitely worth seeing. If you are unwilling to shell out a few dollars for a ticket, you can [download the presentation itself.](http://climatechangeaction.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-of-week-al-gore-inconvenient_28.html)

_A Prairie Home Companion_ — This was a really slow movie that didn't really go anywhere.

_Superman Returns_ — It felt like a Superman movie. That's all I really wanted from this one.

_Dead Man's Chest_ — In adventure stories, the coin of the realm is strangeness. Think of the Barsoom stories.

<p><a href="http://magnatune.com/artists/processor">Processor_</a>'s <em>Insomia</em> rocks.  It's electronica with just enough variation-on-a-theme so that it doesn't suffer from excessive repetition.  It makes good use of sampled voices (e.g. MLK, which is a bit of a clich&eacute;).  </p>
<p>Is it original?  Not at all.  I swear I've heard the title track before.  But does that really matter? Not at all.</p>

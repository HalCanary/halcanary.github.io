<p>When you give your address or email to any corporate entity, they immediately begin to junkmail/spam you. But I need that line of communication. I have to check every piece of mail that looks like it comes from my phone company, insurance company, bank, credit card company, etc; any envelope might contain a bill, and I'd be stupid to forget to pay it. I wish I could have a spam filter for my mailbox that would reject anything which was not a bitt or personal correspondance. </p>
<p>If I gave all of these people my email address for an electronic bill, they'd just take that as an invitation to spam me, and I'd be even less likely to find the signal within the noise. </p>
<p>And forget automatic bill payment. Why would I trust an automatic system to find errors in bills?</p>

<p>The <em>London Times</em> will no longer print a broadsheet edition; instead they will print only an easy to read tabloid edition.  (<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1336148,00.html">source</a>)</p>
<p>I've always hated the size of boradsheets.  They are too big to fold easily.  So why are they that size? &ldquo;Historically, broadsheets were developed when in 1712 a tax was placed on British newspapers based on the number of their pages.&rdquo; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet">source</a>)</p>

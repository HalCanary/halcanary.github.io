<p>Neal Stephenson is obsessed with money.  I'm reading<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060523867/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>the Confusion</em></a> right now, and as always, Eliza is trying to figure out <em>what</em> money is in order to learn <em>how</em> to get more of it.</p>
<p>It's one of those subjects that I just don't get.  What exactly backs a US Federal Reserve Note?<br />
I still can't figure that one out.</p>
<p>Originlly, the dollar was 24.06 g Ag or 1.60 g Au.<br />
Then it was 1.5 g Au.  Then 0.89 g Au.  Then 0.82 g Au.<br />
Now it's a piece of paper that can be taken to the loacal tavern and traded for alcohol.  Good enough for me, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong> Also note that the ratio of the dime to quarter is 10/25.  Why?  They were both originally siver coins, like the dollar itself.  They were worth exactly thier weight in silver.</p>

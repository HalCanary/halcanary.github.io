I saw Zhang Yimou's _House of Flying Daggers_ on Saturday. If you liked _Hero_, then you will probably like this one a little better. Ther story is a bit more tight. If you hated _Hero_, then I don't know what you would think of this one.

Again, it has beautiful cinimatography. Again, the plot has twists and turns. I liked Ziyi Zhang's performace in this one a lot.

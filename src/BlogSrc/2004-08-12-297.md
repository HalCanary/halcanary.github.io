![[keyboard image]](https://halcanary.org/images/keyboard-touch-type.jpg)  
This image shows a keybord with keys color-coded as to what finger you are supposed to use to hit each key. My issue: my D-finger doesn't want to hit the C-key without moving my whole hand.  
Why does the layout of the keys and the geometry of my hand conflict with how they teach you top type?

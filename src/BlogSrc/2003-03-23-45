I went out and bought a [GBA SP](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2003-01-08) today. I love it. It's so tiny and beautiful. I also picked up Metroid Fusion, which is wonderfully old-school, yet beautiful. I hadn't had a gameboy since the first generation of them came out, back in the day. But I still have my old games (Tetris, Metroid II, Pinball, some others), which work on the GBA platform, even though the larger cartridges stick out a bit. Something fun to do on long bus rides.

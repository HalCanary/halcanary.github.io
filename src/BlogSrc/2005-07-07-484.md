People like me read the encylopedia for fun.

Today I read about Li-ion batteries. [“ At a typical 100% charge level at 25 degrees Celsius, Li-ion batteries irreversibly lose approximately 20% capacity per year from the time they are manufactured, even when unused.”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery)

<blockquote><p>Quite frankly, I don't _want_ people using Linux for ideological reasons.  I think ideology sucks. This world would be a much better place if people had less ideology, and a whole lot more &quot;I do this because it's FUN and because others might find it useful, not because I got religion&quot;.</p>

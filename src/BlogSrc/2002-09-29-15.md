I got the style preferences to work under IE6. I still don't know why it was crashing, though. The fix is a bit of a kludge.

Was bored this morning, so I went to church. They altered the prayers of the people. The new version:

> _We pray that our leaders may govern with humility,  
> that they not be full of selfish ambition or conceit..._

The old version (form I):

> _For our President, for the leaders of the nations,  
> and for all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.  
> Lord, have mercy._

I'm not sure what to make of the change. I think somebody's saying that our leaders are more evil today and that we no longer want the Lord to have mercy for them.

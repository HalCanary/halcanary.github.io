<p>In a properly configured Fedora/Redhat system you can install MySQL  with yum.  You'll need atleast the following packages: mysql-server,  mysql, and <strong>php-mysql</strong>, as well as php and httpd.  Assuming  that your web server is already set up and working with php.</p>
<pre>$ sudo yum install mysql-server mysql php-mysql</pre>
<p>(Restart httpd after installing php-mysql.)  With a fresh install  of mysql, you'll need to start the server daemon and set things  up.</p>
<pre>
$ sudo /sbin/service httpd restart
$ sudo /sbin/service mysqld start
$ sudo /sbin/chkconfig --level 35 mysqld on
</pre>
<p>The mysql "root" password is initially blank, so don't worry and  hit return if it prompts you:</p>
<pre>
$ mysqladmin -u root -p password 'pick_a_good_password'
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
mysql&gt; GRANT ALL ON wordpress.*
       TO wordpress_user@localhost
       IDENTIFIED BY 'pick_another_good_password';
</pre>
<p>Now you are set. Write down that info:</p>
<pre>
    WORDPRESS INFO:
Database Name : wordpress
User Name     : wordpress_user
Password      : pick_another_good_password
Database Host : localhost
Table Prefix  : wp1_
</pre>
<p>  Now, download the latest version from:   <a href="http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz">    http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz</a> .  Then as a user with    write access to /var/www/html, do:</p>
<pre>
$ cd /var/www/html
$ <strong>wget</strong> -nv http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
$ tar xzf latest.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>Then it should be as simple as pointing your browser to   <a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php">    http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php</a>  snd going from there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 2004-08-27</strong>  How I installed Wordpress on halcanary.org.</p>
<p>Since I already had a MySQL database set up, I just had to choose a uniqe prefix.  Movable Type tables use the prefix mt_.  So I set my Wordpress prefix to wp1_.  Here are the tables used by both programs, according to phpMyAdmin:</p>
<pre>
mt_author	wp1_categories
mt_blog		wp1_comments
mt_category	wp1_linkcategories
mt_comment	wp1_links
mt_entry	wp1_optiongroup_options
mt_ipbanlist	wp1_optiongroups
mt_log		wp1_options
mt_notification	wp1_optiontypes
mt_permission	wp1_optionvalues
mt_placement	wp1_post2cat
mt_plugindata	wp1_postmeta
mt_tbping	wp1_posts
mt_template	wp1_users
mt_templatemap
mt_trackback
</pre>
<p>I'm getting ahead of myself.  Before I got that far, I unpacked the wordpress tarball locally, used a gui ftp program to recursivly copy over the directory.  I renamed ~/public_html/wordpress/ to ~/public_html/wp/ for brevity's sake.  I then had to change the permission mode on that directory to 777 so that the install program could make the wp-config.php file.  Then I made a ~/public_html/b/ directory and copied index.php from the wp/ directory there.  This way my permlinks will be to https://halcanary.org/b/, and not to https://halcanary.org/wp/.</p>
<p>Then I browsed to http://halcanary/wp/ and did the setup.</p>

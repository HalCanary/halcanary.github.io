<p>It's been too long. I've now been in classed for two weeks. I'm taking three classes and having too much fun. </p>
<p>As a result of spending a lot of time on campus. This week I've started abusing the network by running p2p apps. I got several cartoons off of <a href="http://www.kazaalite.com/">Kazaa Lite</a>, including a few Sealab 2021 episodes.</p>
<p>I think I'll go home and nap before going out for the evening. This will require catching the bus.</p>

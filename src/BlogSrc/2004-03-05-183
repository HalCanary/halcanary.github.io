<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html">A=B</a> on my cmputer and I thought: "Gee, wouldn't it be nice to have this printed out and bound?"  It is 222 pages long.  I could print it out myself and be out a bit of toner and half a ream of paper.  Less than $3.</p>
<p>Then I thought, "I could save paper by finding a duplex printer!  Or even better, have Kinkos print out a copy and bind it.  Maybe I'd pay a premium."  I figured that would double the cost to have someone else press some buttons.  No.   $21.60.  Can you believe that?  I could buy a  real copy of the book for that much!</p>

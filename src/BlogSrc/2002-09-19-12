<p>Last weekend, I picked up a couple of O'Reilly books at the store: <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em> by David Flanagan, and <em>Programming Perl</em> (the camel book) by Larry Wall, et all. </p>
<p>I've found that JavaScript (js) is a much easier to grok if you think of it as a real language. And there's a lot of cool things that can be done with the W3C DOM. </p>
<p>Perl, on the other hand, is cool, but it's syntax is too complicated. A comparason is in order. YOu can learn all there is to know about Java's syntax in a short time, but it would take years of effort to lean everything that can be done with the language. With Perl, it takes a long time to grok the eccentricies of the syntax, but as soon as you do, you know how to do anything with the language.  </p>
<p>Is there a word for this concept? I guess that Java is a minimalistic OOP language, while Perl is a maxamalistic language that allows OOP structures. As a logician, I hate Perl. As a hacker, I have a lot of respect for anyone who has mastered it.</p>

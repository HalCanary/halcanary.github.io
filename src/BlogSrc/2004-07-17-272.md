If you have problems getting your .htaccess files working, don't forget to insert "`AllowOverride All`" into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.

I've been having fun with mod\_rewrite. For example:

    
    ## public_html/archives/.htaccess
    ## from halcanary.org
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase   /
    RewriteRule ^cat$ /archives/cat.php [L]
    ## EOF
    

So [`/archives/cat`](/archives/cat) is just a pointer to [`/archives/cat.php`](/archives/cat.php).

The whole `/p/*` directory is just a pointer to a single php script.

<p>The other morning I got mad at my clock radio and hit it.</p>
<p>Hard.</p>
<p>It doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I feel bad.  I got that clock sometime in the late 80s.  I was fond of it.</p>
<p>Why was I angry?  One of those fascists  praising GWB for his taxcuts -- "giving the people their money back"  -- while supporting an expensive war and refusing to adequately fund schools. Chapman had the perfect <a href="/images/taxes.png">graphic</a> for this:  Two pie graphs, the first is  government spending  as a part of GDP.  The second is taxes as part of GDP.  In the long run, those slices HAVE to be balanced.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-07-16:</strong> It turns out that new clock radios sell for $5 at Wallmart.  Same features, streamlined production --&gt; cheap conusmer goods.</p>

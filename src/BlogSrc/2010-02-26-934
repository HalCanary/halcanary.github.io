Stew Thing Recipe.  
(A work in progress. I'm making it up as I go.)

*   Half a pound of cooked, then rinsed lentils
*   One can of red beans, rinsed
*   One can of black beans, rinsed
*   Chopped carrots, bell peppers, and onions
*   Olive oil
*   Salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder

1.  Start cooking the lentils first.
2.  Rinse the beans.
3.  After around fifteen minutes, start saut√©ing the veggies in oil; use a shallow pot; add generous amounts of the spices.
4.  Rinse the lentils after they are done cooking.
5.  Add the beans and lentils.
6.  Mix it all together; add more spices; add some water; let it cook together.

Should I add cumin? Fresh garlic?

Serve over rice, unless you want to limit your carbohydrate intake.

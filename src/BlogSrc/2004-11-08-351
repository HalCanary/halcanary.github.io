<blockquote><p>Q: You talk about how the radical conservatives have distorted the term "liberalism." What's your definition of liberalism?</p>
<p>A:</p>
<p>[1] Keeping church and state separate. </p>
<p>[2] Fighting concentrations of economic power that undermine democracy.</p>
<p>[3] Expanding social insurance, including health care. </p>
<p>[4] And extending the reach of international law and human rights. </p>
<p>These principles all interact. They have to do with the interdependence of all of us.</p>

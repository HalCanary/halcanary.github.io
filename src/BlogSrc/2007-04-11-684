<p>This is a post I wrote almost a month ago and never posted:</p>
<p>2007-03-11</p>
<p>I went to the Linux Users Group the other night.  The local LUG tries to have a presentation at every month's meeting.  This is ambitious goal, so I thought I'd help out.  I went home and started putting together a presentation on F/OSS crytography tools.</p>
<p>Then I realized that if I was going to give a presentation in front of the Linux group, I ought to get Linux working on my laptop.  This has been a problem since I got this used laptop two years ago, since the CDROM drive refuses to read any CDs I put in it.  So I did more research this week and found out that I can <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=118182">bootstrap from inside windows a copy of linux to run a network installer</a>.</p>
<p>I chose to install Ubuntu Linux because it has a reputation for good support for wifi cards.  Without WiFi, a notebook is mostly useless to me.  I had never installed Ubuntu before.  In a sense, I still havn't: I install XUbuntu instead.  XUbuntu is a scaled down version of Ubuntu that is supposed to use less resources by replacing Gnome with Xfce.</p>
<pre>$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | head -8
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 8
model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
stepping        : 10
cpu MHz         : 700.000
cache size      : 256 KB

$ cat /proc/meminfo  | head -1
MemTotal:       385828 kB</pre>
<p>This thing has got a 700 MHz Pentium III (Coppermine mobile) processor, which makes the processor design almost seven years old.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this setup:</p>
<p>1) (X)Ubuntu works pretty well.  I'm in the proccess of learning all    about apt-get; otherwise a lot of my RH/Fedora knowledge translates    over to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>2) Xfce is still a little rough round the edges, but it does what I   want it to.  I miss Gnome's Rhythmbox and Gedit, but I should learn   to make do with less.</p>
<p>3) The wireless drivers work perfectly, BUT the GUI frontend   (network-admin) is useless.  I ended up writing my own scripts.   This one lists all the availible networks.</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/scanwifi
## 2007 Hal Canary
## Dedicated to the Public Domain
sudo echo 'Restarting and scanning Wifi...'
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; ifconfig eth1 down &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1 down
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; ifconfig eth1 up &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1 up
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwconfig eth1 essid any &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo iwconfig eth1 essid any
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwconfig eth1 &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo ifconfig eth1
echo '&gt;&gt;&gt; iwlist eth1 scanning &gt;&gt;&gt;'
sudo iwlist eth1 scanning
exit 0</pre>
<p>This one connects to the selected network:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/connectwifi
## 2007 Hal Canary
## Dedicated to the Public Domain
if [ &quot;$#&quot; -lt 1 ] ; then
	echo &quot;useage:&quot;
	echo &quot;  $0 SSID&quot;
	echo &quot;or:&quot;
	echo &quot;  $0 SSID KEY&quot;
	exit 1
fi
echo '########## iwconfig eth1 essid &quot;'$1'&quot; ########'
sudo iwconfig eth1 essid &quot;$1&quot;
if [ ! -z &quot;$2&quot; ] ; then
	echo '########## iwconfig eth1 key &quot;'$2'&quot; ########'
	sudo iwconfig eth1 key &quot;$2&quot;
fi
echo '########## dhclient eth1 ########'
sudo dhclient eth1
exit 0;</pre>
<p>   And this one connects to my home network (not my real key):</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
## ~/bin/connectwifi.MySsid
connectwifi MySsid 0c0dc52de9fbc078f3c1411100</pre>
<p>Disconnecting can be accomplished with a</p>
<pre>sudo ifconfig eth1 down</pre>
<p>or by simply removing the network card.</p>
<p>4) In theory this laptop's battery has only about an hour's charge on   it, but I think that if I keep disc and CPU useage down to a   minimum, it can last longer.  I've been sitting here outside for   almost an hour and it's at 46%.  This is to be expected with a   LiIon battery this old.  If I get a new battery for this thing, it   would cost around $100.  We got this whole laptop for less than   that.</p>
<p>5) It's geeting cold out, so I'm going to go home now.</p>
<p>6) Ubuntu disallows the use of the login name 'hal', reserving it for   the hardware abstraction layer daemon.  This makes me sad.</p>
<p>7) Ubuntu has a much more lax default security policy.  Iptables is   off my default.  There is no SELinux.</p>

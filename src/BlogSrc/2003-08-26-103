Here's little script that check to see if the ssh-agent knows any keys. If not, it asks for your passphrase. Then it executes ssh.

    #!/bin/sh
    #DTPD#
    ## $HOME/bin/ssh ##
    if ! (ssh-add -l > /dev/null); then
      ssh-add;
    fi
    echo ssh "$@";
    exec /usr/bin/ssh "$@";

Of course you have to have the ssh-agent working correctly in the first place.

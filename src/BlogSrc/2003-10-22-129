<p>I downloaded iTunes for windows the other day. I had seen the program  before, most notably running the music for all of Aaron's partys for the  last three years, abut I had not used it before.</p>
<p>It seems vastly superior to Windows Media Player, but I can't put my  finger on how. Compared to Musicmatch Jukebox (which crashed whenever I  tried to update my ipod), it is wonderful.</p>
<p>It would seem that the apple design philosophy is to hide most options  from the user. So I had to go looking for help on turning on Manual Mode  iPod syncing. Most users would have given up.</p>
<p>I've bought two albums on the iTMS. I'm not sure if that's a good thing yet.</p>
<p>My iPod playlist os now 1690 songs, 5.2days/7.19Gb of Music. I better go ahead and fill it up.</p>
<p>...Uh oh. I just got an error while updating the iPod. Hey, at least no programs crashed! I'll just reformat the disc. That usually helps, especially after a firmware upgrade.</p>
<p>And now It just lost most of my music library. I'll have to readd those files. And importing files into the library is the one thing that's not properly multithreaded. </p>
<p>I'll let you know how this works out.</p>

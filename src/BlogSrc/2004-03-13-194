<p><em>The Economist</em> is a great news source, even though thay support Bush.  Last week they came out again in support of <a href="http://12reasons.com/">gay marriage</a>.  Here's a reader's response:</p>
<blockquote><p>...In the South, we are stereotyped as homophobes and Bible thumpers but most of us do not view homosexuals as second-class citizens. However, gay relationships should be viewed as second-class in comparison with heterosexual marriages....</p>

<p>And people asked my why I left...</p>

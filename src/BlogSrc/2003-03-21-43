<p>Interesting conversation:<br />
<em>Me:</em> So I sat around all day and watched TV...<br />
<em>Her:</em> Cartoons? <br />
<em>Me:</em> No, the news. I've been watching the war all day, and I ought to  stop watching so much if it.<br><br />
<em>Her:</em> You should watch cartoons instead.</p>
<p>The world would be a much better place if we all watched more cartoons.</p>

![[now with flavor]](/images/bachelor_chow.jpg)

1.  Make some ramen noodles. Feel free to substitute whatever other pasta or rice you have on hand.
2.  Drain water. Use of a collinder is discouraged, because a true bachelor will make this with one pot and one fork. No other dishes to wash.
3.  Add a can of Hormel chili with beans. Mix together.
4.  Heat on medium until everything is hot.
5.  Eat

This meal costs less than a dollar. You get what you pay for.

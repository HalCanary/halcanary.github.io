<p>Interesting dreams. One involved a large university built inside the caldera of a dormant volcano.</p>
<p>Another involved me working two jobs. I got very tired and just started yelling at everybody.</p>
<p>The others were just too wierd to put into words. Like the one about the mutant spider eggs.</p>

<p>I've got an ancient computer monitor from 1999. It's a 19" CRT that takes up a large amount of space on my desk. I'm thinking of buying a new LCD monitor. I'd want something with at least the same amount of screen area.</p>
<p>What is state of the art these days?</p>
<p>Concerns:</p>
<p>1) Image quality for games and movies. What kind of response time do I need?</p>
<p>2) Should I go for 1440x900 or 1280x1024? Which is best for productivity? For movies, the wide screen makes more sense.</p>
<p>3) How long should I expect a good LCD screen to last?</p>
<p>4) Is an analog connection good enough? How much does a DVI connection improve things? Is it worth the extra moneys?</p>
<p>5) How much should I expect to spend?</p>

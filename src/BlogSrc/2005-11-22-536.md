Vacation Day Two.

Went to the [Corkscrew Swamp Sactuary](http://www.audubon.org/local/sanctuary/corkscrew/). The most interesting point in the 2.25 mi hike is when a sign asks you to stop and smell the air. It was possibly the cleanest air you have ever smelled. The sign then quoted a writer from three hundred years ago, who says swamps are places of foul air, disease and decay.

I used to live a few miles from a cypress swamp. It was a cool place.

almost two years ago.  Yes, I know it's crap, Just go ahead and tell me.</p>

<p>Dear Dr. Canary,</p>
<p>We are sorry that your paper is taking so long to process.<br />It is now with its 4th referee, who has had it since July 27<br />this year. The other referees failed to deliver; in particular<br />referee #2 kept promising for a year until I gave up on him.<br />I'm hopeful that the current referee will break the pattern,<br />but in any case I won't be so patient this time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Brendan McKay (Editor-in-Chief) [Electronic Journal of Combinatorics]</p>

It's been too long. I've now been in classed for two weeks. I'm taking three classes and having too much fun. 

As a result of spending a lot of time on campus. This week I've started abusing the network by running p2p apps. I got several cartoons off of [Kazaa Lite](http://www.kazaalite.com/), including a few Sealab 2021 episodes.

I think I'll go home and nap before going out for the evening. This will require catching the bus.

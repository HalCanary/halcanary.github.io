<p>I just got rhythmbox working for the first time.  I needed to do a &ldquo;sudo yum install gstreamer-plugins-mp3&rdquo;.  Of course!</p>
<p>Review to follow.</p>

<p>UPDATE 1:00 pm.</p>
<p>It would seem that I stayed out all night and then came home and figured out how to make rythembox work. Huh?</p>
<p>Okay. here's the deal.  My distro, FC1, ships with a broken copy of xmms.  You can get xmms-mp3 from the Livna.org repository, but xmms still looks like crap.  So if you get Ryhtembox, its dependances (like gstreamer), and gstreamer-plugins-mp3, you get a much better music player.</p>
<p>F, it just hung.  Damnit.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-08-11:</strong>  I've been happy with rhythmbox for the last several months.  I reccomend.  Yet it still needs a few more features.</p>

<p>I changed my look. Special thanks to Mark Chapman, who cut my hair. </p>
<p> Lots of other new things in my life. New advertising campaign:   &ldquo;Need to bring up your grade? ACT NOW!&rdquo;</p>
<p> Took two exams yesterday. The analysis exam had no super hard   questions, but I probably missed some important details in some   of my proofs. I hope for liberal quantities of partial credit.</p>

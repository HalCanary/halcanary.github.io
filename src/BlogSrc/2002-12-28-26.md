[![Laughing gulls on beach, Sanibel, FL, US](https://halcanary.org/photos/thumb/2002-12-27-sanibel12.jpg)](https://halcanary.org/photos/2002-12-27-sanibel12.jpg) I got a telephoto adapter for my camera this week. I took some [photos](https://halcanary.org/p/photos/) with them on the [26th](https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-12-26/) and the [27th](https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2002-12-27/).

I'm just about sick of the south again. I want to go back to Wisconsin, where its too cold for biting insects.

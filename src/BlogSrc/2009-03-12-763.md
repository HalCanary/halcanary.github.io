What have I read over the past year or so? Here's a partial list:

*   Eric Flint (et alia)'s 1632 series.
*   Roger Zelazny's Amber series (reread for the first time since college. They hold up well; I'm going to read more of him.)
*   Randy Wayne White's Doc Ford series.
*   David Weber and John Ringo's Empire of Man series
*   Ursula K. Le Guin's Left _Hand of Darkness_ and three Earthsea books.
*   Michael Williamson's _Better to Beg Forgiveness_
*   Jack McDevitt's _Seeker_
*   Jack Campbell's Lost Fleet series
*   David Weber's Honor Harrington series
*   Barack Obama's _Dreams from My Father_

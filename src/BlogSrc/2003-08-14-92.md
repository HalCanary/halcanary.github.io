By the way, any of my friends who want to use this space to blog are welcome. One caveat, though: I'm not hosting any static files.

I'm also going to streamline \[s\]ome of the back-engine of the site, too. Stop using cookies+ecmascript to do the stylesheet changes, instead just specify a few alternate stylesheets. I've already moved the blog submission form to a htaccess-controlled directory.

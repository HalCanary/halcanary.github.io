Read Mary Doria Russell's _Sparrow_ and _Children of God_. Were very good. I recommend.

Am slightly confused in topology class. I think this is okay. Am finally on payroll in Math department.

Been programming. Have made good progress.

Did landscaping at a friend's house yesterday. Was fun. Still don't want to be responsible for long-term well being of plants or own property.

**UPDATE 2004-08-11:** Links for [_The Sparrow_](/isbn/?0449912558) and [_Children of God_](/isbn/?044900483X).

1.  Someone has made a danceable version of "the Immigrant Song." I like.
2.  Some say I should lose the beard.
3.  Scotch.
4.  After a while, everyone expects me to wear the same clothes every L+L.
5.  I didn't talk to nearly enough people. I never do.
6.  What is Egwene's defining characteristic? Her primary motivation? Ted doesn't know either.
7.  Tomorrow might be a fun day.

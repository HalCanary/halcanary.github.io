<p>After class I went downtown and wandered around. It was too cold, so I went into a coffee shop and studied topology. I learned about the fundamental group of the real projective plane and of the wedge product of two real projective panes, among other things. Tonight I went out and drank.</p>
<p>Still no luck on port forwarding</p>

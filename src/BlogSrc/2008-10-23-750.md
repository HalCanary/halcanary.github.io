"Just as _you suspected_, Barack Obama is _wrong for you_." --John McCain radio ad, heard in FLorida.

Think about this for a while. Why might someone be **suspicious** of Obama? Maybe they don't want to admit out lout that that are afraid of black men. And the "for you" bit: this ties into a segregationist viewpoint where it's okay if Obama wants to be president of black America, but not okay if he wants to be president of **you**, white America. In fact, it would be **wrong** for a black man to be president of **you**.

It's subtle, though.

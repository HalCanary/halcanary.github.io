<p>I noticed that someone had the bright idea to layer Adobe Flash objects *over* images using a <code>&lt;div style=&quot;background-image:url($IMAGE_URL)&quot;&gt;</code>.  That way, when the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433/">Flashblock add-on</a> blocks a Flash object, you can give users an idea of what you are blocking.  Here's <a href="/pub/flashexample.html">an example of the technique in use,</a> but it won't make any sense if you aren't using Flashblock.</p>

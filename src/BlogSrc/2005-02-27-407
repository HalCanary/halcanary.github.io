<p>English is so versatile, no wonder it will replace all other languages within a century. Yeah, English!</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of its profane status and versatility, the word "fuck" can be used many times in an English sentence. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>"Fucking <em>fuck</em> those fucking fuckers!" ("Forget about those very disliked people.")</li>
<li>"Fucking fucker's fucking fucked!" ("It is broken.")</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter example excellently demonstrates the versitility of the word fuck, as each instance represents a different syntactical usage: an article, a noun, a present participle (to is), and an adjective.</p>

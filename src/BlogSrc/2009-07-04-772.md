Say I want to send someone a URL that shows the product page for a given item at Bestbuy.com. I enter the SKU (for example, 9222637) into the search field and I get the following URL:

    http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?
    _dyncharset=ISO-8859-1&_dynSessConf=8937
    304157603088075&id=pcat17071&type=page&s
    t=9222637&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=15&sp=&qp=&
    list=n&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960

Which is too damned long! Why not just send me to a simpler URL:

    http://bestbuy.com/sku/9222637

Some merchants are easer than others. I've learned that given an ISBN (for example, 9781439132739), BN.com's shortest URL is:

    http://search.barnesandnoble.com///e/9781439132739

<p>In the last couple of weeks, I've seen quite a few guys wearing ties at the club.  I'm taking as much responsibility for this as possible:  I started doing that regularly last fall.</p>
<p>There were also large numbers of guys in drag last night.  I had  nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>I also saw someone in a business suit.  I hate those ugly things.  Two words:  padded shoulders.  Ick.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Home is behind, the world ahead,<br />
And there are many paths to tread<br />
Through shadows to the edge of night<br />
Until the stars are all alight.<br />
Mist and shadow, cloud and shade,<br />
Away shall fade ! Away shall fade!</em></p>
<p>&mdash;Tolkien(*)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(*) In the movie <em>Return of the King</em> the original word of the walking song were altered.  &ldquo;Mist and twilight&rdquo; became &ldquo;mist and shadow.&rdquo;  Lines line &ldquo;Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,/And then to bed! And then to bed!&rdquo; were left out because they were not sufficently moody.</p>
<p>I like the movie version.</p>

(\*) In the movie _Return of the King_ the original word of the walking song were altered. “Mist and twilight” became “mist and shadow.” Lines line “Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,/And then to bed! And then to bed!” were left out because they were not sufficently moody.

I like the movie version.

<p>I was smoking a cigarette with Sara and Kyle two days ago, and Kyle mentioned that he has six cups of coffee every morning.  </p>
<p><strong>Six Cups.</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the secret of Kyle's successful life.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a full pot of hot tea and a jug of cold tea.  I felt very productive, and I was only able to sleep 7 hours.  I'm going to do that every day.</p>

The other morning I got mad at my clock radio and hit it.

Hard.

It doesn't work anymore.

I feel bad. I got that clock sometime in the late 80s. I was fond of it.

Why was I angry? One of those fascists praising GWB for his taxcuts -- "giving the people their money back" -- while supporting an expensive war and refusing to adequately fund schools. Chapman had the perfect [graphic](https://halcanary.org/images/taxes.png) for this: Two pie graphs, the first is government spending as a part of GDP. The second is taxes as part of GDP. In the long run, those slices HAVE to be balanced.

**UPDATE 2004-07-16:** It turns out that new clock radios sell for $5 at Wallmart. Same features, streamlined production --> cheap conusmer goods.

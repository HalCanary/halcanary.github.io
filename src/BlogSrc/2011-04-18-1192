<p>I will be moving 2.7&deg; to the east.  Therefore, sunrises will, on average, be about eleven minutes earlier!  Sunrises, like tea, make it easier for me to be awake.  Due to differences in Latitude, this should vary over the course of the year.  For instance, today the sunrise there is 21 minutes earlier.</p>

This week, I finally broke down and bought an ebook reader — B&N's $150 WiFi [Nook](http://bn.com/nook/) (ISBN 9781400532629). It's a beautiful little device.

I got the Jonathan Adler Punctuation Cover (978161560062) since it's both very sturdy and cheaper than most.

I've already side-loaded 90 free books onto the device. These books have come from several places. In no particular order:

*   The Lee County Public Library lets you borrow ebooks via Adobe Digital
    Editions (ADE) software. You can use ADE to side-load ebooks onto a nook.

*   [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) — the first place to go for
    books from the public domain. All of their books are now availible in ePub
    versions.

*   [Google Books](http://books.google.com/), Some of the scans availible are
    in the public domain, and are therefore downloadable. Generally, the
    Gutenberug editions are a higher quality than the Google versions, since
    The Gutenberg tries to be an ideal textual copy of the book while Google
    tries to be a good representation a particular physical book.

*   Many of the works of Cory Doctorow are availible as ePubs on his website,
    [Craphound](http://craphound.com/). I especially recommend _Makers_
    and _Little Brother_.

*   [The Baen Free Library](http://www.baen.com/library/titles.htm) — All
    copyrighted works which you may read for free, and all are availible as
    ePubs.

*   [The Baen CD Mirror](http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/) — These files
    are also copyrighted but free to redistribute. The newer CDs have ePub
    files on them. The older CDs do not, but you can use a program like
    [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to covert file formats.

Places to buy eBooks:

*   [http://bn.com/ebooks](https://web.archive.org/web/20100629211148/http://www.barnesandnoble.com/ebooks/) —
    of course. Also check the
    [Unbound Blog](http://bn.com/unbound) every friday for the name of a free book
    that can be added to your B&N library that week. \[Update. Here, too:
    [http://bn.com/freelibrary](http://bn.com/freelibrary)\]

*   [Webscription](http://www.webscription.net/) — A store that sells
    unencombered ebooks, all of which are availible in ePub format. The prices
    aren't bad at all.

This week, I finally broke down and bought an ebook reader — B&N's $150 WiFi [Nook](http://bn.com/nook/) (ISBN 9781400532629). It's a beautiful little device.

I got the Jonathan Adler Punctuation Cover (978161560062) since it's both very sturdy and cheaper than most.

I've already side-loaded 90 free books onto the device. These books have come from several places. In no particular order:

<div class="indent"><p>• The Lee County Public Library lets you borrow ebooks via Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software. You can use ADE to side-load ebooks onto a nook.</p><p>• <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> — the first place to go for books from the public domain. All of their books are now availible in ePub versions.</p><p>• <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, Some of the scans availible are in the public domain, and are therefore downloadable. Generally, the Gutenberug editions are a higher quality than the Google versions, since The Gutenberg tries to be an ideal textual copy of the book while Google tries to be a good representation a particular physical book.</p><p>• Many of the works of Cory Doctorow are availible as ePubs on his website, <a href="http://craphound.com/">Craphound</a>. I especially recommend <em>Makers</em> and <em>Little Brother</em>.</p><p>• <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/titles.htm">The Baen Free Library</a> — All copyrighted works which you may read for free, and all are availible as ePubs.</p><p>• <a href="http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/">The Baen CD Mirror</a> — These files are also copyrighted but free to redistribute. The newer CDs have ePub files on them. The older CDs do not, but you can use a program like <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to covert file formats.</p></div>

Places to buy eBooks:

<div class="indent"><p>• <a href="http://bn.com/ebooks">http://bn.com/ebooks</a> — of course. Also check the <a href="http://bn.com/unbound">Unbound Blog</a> every friday for the name of a free book that can be added to your B&amp;N library that week. [Update. Here, too: <a href="http://bn.com/freelibrary">http://bn.com/freelibrary</a>]</p><p>• <a href="http://www.webscription.net/">Webscription</a> — A store that sells unencombered ebooks, all of which are availible in ePub format. The prices aren't bad at all.</p></div>

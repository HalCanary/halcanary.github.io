I downloaded iTunes for windows the other day. I had seen the program before, most notably running the music for all of Aaron's partys for the last three years, abut I had not used it before.

It seems vastly superior to Windows Media Player, but I can't put my finger on how. Compared to Musicmatch Jukebox (which crashed whenever I tried to update my ipod), it is wonderful.

It would seem that the apple design philosophy is to hide most options from the user. So I had to go looking for help on turning on Manual Mode iPod syncing. Most users would have given up.

I've bought two albums on the iTMS. I'm not sure if that's a good thing yet.

My iPod playlist os now 1690 songs, 5.2days/7.19Gb of Music. I better go ahead and fill it up.

...Uh oh. I just got an error while updating the iPod. Hey, at least no programs crashed! I'll just reformat the disc. That usually helps, especially after a firmware upgrade.

And now It just lost most of my music library. I'll have to readd those files. And importing files into the library is the one thing that's not properly multithreaded.

I'll let you know how this works out.

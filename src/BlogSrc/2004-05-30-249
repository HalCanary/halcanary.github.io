<p>Odd issue in linux/x11.  I used to have the evil proprietary Nvidia drivers loaded.  I gave up on them recently, but once I installed a new kernel without them, glx (openGL for x) stopped working.  I got the error:</p>
<p><code>Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"</code></p>
<p>It should have worked, as the file <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.a</code> should have provided this funtionality. </p>
<p>But alas, Xorg X11 was using the file <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.so.1.0.5336</code>, left over from the proprietary driver.  I deleted this file, restarted X11, and it all workes correctly!  I have a fast enough processor that most small openGL apps work fine without hardware acceleration.</p>

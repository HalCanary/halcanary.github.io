 [![[Thumb]](https://halcanary.org/photos/thumb/2003-06-15-beach-06.jpg)](https://halcanary.org/photos/2003-06-15-beach-06.jpg)I put up more [photos from last month's traveling.](https://halcanary.org/p/photo-2003-06/)

I learned a few cool things recently. How to rotate an image with the gimp (especially useful when there is a horizonatal horizon): Use the transform tool. I had never noticed that button before; I kept looking for rotation in the context menu, but that's the wrong place to look.

Also, if you've got a B&W printer and want to print off a color image, use the "convert -charcoal" command to create a new image.

These are my new spamassassin rules.  If your configured email client fails to have a valid DKIM or DK signature or SPF record, I'm probably going to mark you as spam.

```
# .spamassassin/user_prefs
required_score -1.0
score DKIM_VALID_AU -10.0
score SPF_PASS -5.0
```

99% of my legitimate correspondents are okay already.

I was reading [A=B](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wilf/Downld.html) on my cmputer and I thought: "Gee, wouldn't it be nice to have this printed out and bound?" It is 222 pages long. I could print it out myself and be out a bit of toner and half a ream of paper. Less than $3.

Then I thought, "I could save paper by finding a duplex printer! Or even better, have Kinkos print out a copy and bind it. Maybe I'd pay a premium." I figured that would double the cost to have someone else press some buttons. No. $21.60. Can you believe that? I could buy a real copy of the book for that much!

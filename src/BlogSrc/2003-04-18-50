<p>I did extremely bad on that analysis exam last week. I should start doing homework in that class.</p>

<h4>Even More Linux Crap</h4>
<p>We installed rh9 onto the ups server/workstation. Gnome is not useable on a pII-233, and there are no smaller windowmanagers. So we installed windowmaker. I find that using <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/wmbuildmenu/">this script</a> helps with getting the windowmaker menus into good shape.</p>
<p>Linux on the Vaio is utterly unusable right now. I'm not going to fool with it any more for a while. The other day, I booted into windows, installed <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">putty</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/">phoenix</a> and got some work done...by sshing into a linux server and doing my work there. </p>

<p>Happy Good Friday. Except that it's not a particularly happy holiday. It's all about sin and death. [Hal rummages through his old tapes.] Here we go: my copy of <em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. No holy week could be complete without a thourough listening to JCS. I'll probably play some Bach passions as well.</p>

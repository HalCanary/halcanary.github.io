<p>This week, I finally broke down and bought an ebook reader &mdash;   B&amp;N's $150 WiFi <a href="http://bn.com/nook/">Nook</a> (ISBN 9781400532629).  It's a beautiful   little device.</p>
<p>I got the Jonathan Adler Punctuation Cover (978161560062) since   it's both very sturdy and cheaper than most.</p>
<p>I've already side-loaded 90 free books onto the device.  These   books have come from several places.  In no particular order:</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>&bull; The Lee County Public Library lets you borrow ebooks via Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software.  You can use ADE to side-load ebooks onto a nook.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> &mdash; the first place to go for books from the public domain.  All of their books are now availible in ePub versions.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://books.google.com/">Google Books</a>, Some of the scans availible are in the public domain, and are therefore downloadable.  Generally, the Gutenberug editions are a higher quality than the Google versions, since The Gutenberg tries to be an ideal textual copy of the book while Google tries to be a good representation a particular physical book.</p>
<p>&bull; Many of the works of Cory Doctorow are availible as ePubs on his website, <a href="http://craphound.com/">Craphound</a>. I especially recommend <em>Makers</em> and <em>Little Brother</em>.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/titles.htm">The Baen Free Library</a> &mdash; All copyrighted works which you may read for free, and all are availible as ePubs.</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/">The Baen CD Mirror</a> &mdash; These files are also copyrighted but free to redistribute.  The newer CDs have ePub files on them. The older CDs do not, but you can use a program like   <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> to covert file formats.</p>

<p> Places to buy eBooks:</p>
<div class="indent">
<p>&bull; <a href="http://bn.com/ebooks">http://bn.com/ebooks</a> &mdash; of course.  Also check the <a href="http://bn.com/unbound">Unbound Blog</a> every friday for the name of a free book that can be added to your B&amp;N library that week.  [Update.  Here, too: <a href="http://bn.com/freelibrary">http://bn.com/freelibrary</a>]</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="http://www.webscription.net/">Webscription</a> &mdash; A store that sells unencombered ebooks, all of which are availible in ePub format.  The prices aren't bad at all.</p>

<p>Right now I'm not buying new books because i'm in super-thrifty mode.  (I did, however buy a new compass (a <a href="http://www.brunton.com/product.php?id=92">Brunton 26DNL</a>) that floats for my next kayacking trip.  Not that it is easy to get lost when you are on a river.  You're either going upstream or downstream. I bame the DVDs of <em>Lost</em>.)  One book that I'm not buying due to the moratorium on new books is <em>The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</em> (ISBN 0812976568).</p>
<p>Inside the <em>Gospel</em> are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_of_the_Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Captain_Mosey_and_the_Eight_.22I.27d_Really_Rather_You_Didn.27ts.22">The Eight "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts"</a>, commandments for Pastafarians.  I especially like number 5:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>5.</strong> I'd Really Rather You Didn't Challenge The Bigoted, Misogynist, Hateful Ideas Of Others On An Empty Stomach. Eat, Then Go After The Bastard.</p></blockquote>

I did extremely bad on that analysis exam last week. I should start doing homework in that class.

### Even More Linux Crap

We installed rh9 onto the ups server/workstation. Gnome is not useable on a pII-233, and there are no smaller windowmanagers. So we installed windowmaker. I find that using [this script](http://freshmeat.net/projects/wmbuildmenu/) helps with getting the windowmaker menus into good shape.

Linux on the Vaio is utterly unusable right now. I'm not going to fool with it any more for a while. The other day, I booted into windows, installed [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and [phoenix](http://mozilla.org/projects/phoenix/) and got some work done...by sshing into a linux server and doing my work there.

Happy Good Friday. Except that it's not a particularly happy holiday. It's all about sin and death. \[Hal rummages through his old tapes.\] Here we go: my copy of _Jesus Christ Superstar_. No holy week could be complete without a thourough listening to JCS. I'll probably play some Bach passions as well.

Rob Balder, creator of [_PartiallyClips_](http://www.partiallyclips.com/), suggested that no matter how boring the flag of Virginia is, it is still cool because it featured a female human breast. ([the discussion](http://hwc.livejournal.com/51754.html))

Andrew Rogers suggests scrapping the original flag---which features the [state seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Virginia) desiged by George Mason---for [something more geometrical](http://www.andrewrogers.net/Flags/new_state_flags.htm#Virginia_).

I still say you could jazz up the original design just a bit and make something very good:

Old flag:

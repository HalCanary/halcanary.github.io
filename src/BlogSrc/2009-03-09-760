<p>According to maps.google.com, my longitude is -81.803888 degrees.  This puts my house 5.45359253 hours befind Greenwich, England.  Call it 5 hours, 27 minutes, and almost 13 seconds.  This morning I woke up at 6 AM, Eastern Daylight time, UTC-4; so I got up at 10 AM UTC.  This means I got up this morning at 4:32:47 local mean solar time.</p>

<p>I listented to a couple of good things on the radio and the internet recently.  (This morning's <em>To the Best of Our Knowledge</em> and <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail554.html">this</a>)  The drawback of hearing really good things is that it's more difficult to cut-and-paste or bookmark really good quotations.</p>
<p>When reading, you can go back and re-read the interesting parts.</p>

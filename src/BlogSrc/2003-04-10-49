<p>Note: the fact that .Xdefauts doesn't work is due to the fact that the file has been renamed .Xresources.</p>
<p>I tried installing Red Hat 9 onto my Vaio SRX87 this week. The install program did see my hard drive and firewire CD-Rom. I repartitioned and installed. Everything worked great, except for:</p>
<ol>
<li>modem. I need to search for linmodem drivers</li>
<li>wireless. It was not auto detected, as far as I can tell.    Maybe there's a simple workaround.</li>
<li>plug and play usb keyboard and mouse.</li>
<li>The usb-uhci kernal modult keeps giving error messages.</li>
<li>No way to adjust display brightness to save battery life.</li>
<li>No Hibernation.</li>
<li>Some other instabilities, possibly due to usb-uhci errors</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all possible show stoppers. So I wiped the hard drive and reallocated 9 Gb for windows and 11 Gb for linux partitions. Now it's a dual boot system. </p>
<p>It's a great computer, but Sony needs to get behind OSS.</p>
<p>My next project is to upgrade the ups server/workstation.</p>

<p>I have an exam friday evening at 6:30. Can you believe that?</p>

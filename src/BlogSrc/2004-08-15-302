<p>In the last three years, I have rented maybe one movie on VHS.  The only reason I keep my VHS player is to play my original-edition <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy (which will never be availible on DVD). </p>
<p>I've been striving to simplify my system.  I'm getting close to the ideal:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2004-08-15_av_sys_1.png" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>Gone are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tape deck</li>
<li>VHS (It can be plugged into the TV if I need it.)</li>
<li>DVD player</li>
<li>CD player</li>
</ul>
<p>I would someday like to replace my big computer case with a tiny <a href="http://us.shuttle.com/">Shuttle</a> computer, my CRT TV  with either a LCD screen or a projector, and my amplifier with something smaller.</p>

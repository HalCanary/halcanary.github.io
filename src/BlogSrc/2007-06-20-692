<p>I got my Kill-A-Watt electricity usage monitor in the mail today. So far I have discovered:</p>
<p>1) When completely powered off, the computer power supply and the television consume 5 watts each.</p>
<p>2) The computer speakers/subwoofer consumes around seven watts if the power is off and around seven watts if the power is on.</p>
<p>3) The 19 inch LCD monitor consumes very little power when off and around 26 watts when on. (Most of which is radiated as visible light.)</p>
<p>4) The CPU consumes around 99 watts when running smoothly and not spinning the drives much.</p>

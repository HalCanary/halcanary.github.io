When mutt is told to [gpg](http://gnupg.org/) sign an email, it will use
[Quoted-Printable
Content-Transfer-Encoding](http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/RFC/1521/6.htm), which
will replace `" \n"` with `"=20\n"`, an escape sequence of some sort. (ASCII
" " is 0x20.)

I'd rather replace `" \n"` with `"\n"` anyways. Here's some elisp code to do just that:

```Emacs Lisp
;; ~/.emacs ;;
(defun hal1 () (interactive)
  (auto-mega-replace  " \n" "\n"))
(defun auto-mega-replace (arg1 arg2)
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-buffer)
    (while (search-forward arg1)
      (beginning-of-buffer)
      (perform-replace arg1 arg2
        nil nil nil)
      (beginning-of-buffer))))
```

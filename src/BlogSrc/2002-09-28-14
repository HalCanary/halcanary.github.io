<p>Okay, here's the new page, at the new site, <em>halcanary.org</em>. The page is dynamically created. I wrote a couple of perl scripts that do the job. </p>
<p>There's still a lot that's missing. I've done the work, I just need to put it in place. Here's a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefs &amp; styles</li>
<li>The other pages.</li>
<li>logins for guests
<ul>
<li>a way to post to the blog via cgi</li>
<li>allow guests to post to the blog too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>view old blog entries</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

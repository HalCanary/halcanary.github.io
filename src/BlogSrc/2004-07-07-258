A couple of weeks ago I got sick of the whole propritary/binary Nvidia graphics drivers. So I searched around for the best ATI chip that 3D graphics drivers in [Xorg X11](http://freedesktop.org/~xorg/X11R6.7.0/doc/radeon.4.html#sect3). I bought a [ATI Radeon 9200](http://www.asenashop.com/sfitem/id-6919/pr-0). The 3-D driver is a bit buggy, but no worse than any binary drivers I've used. And I can hope that support for this card does nothing but improve.

Of course the only games I have that take advantage of 3-d on linux are Quake 3 and RtCW.

<p>A couple of weeks ago I got sick of the whole propritary/binary Nvidia graphics drivers.  So I searched around for the best ATI chip that 3D graphics drivers in  <a href="http://freedesktop.org/~xorg/X11R6.7.0/doc/radeon.4.html#sect3">Xorg X11</a>.  I bought a  <a href="http://www.asenashop.com/sfitem/id-6919/pr-0">ATI Radeon 9200</a>.  The 3-D driver is a bit buggy, but no worse than any binary drivers I've used.  And I can hope that support for this card does nothing but improve.</p>
<p>Of course the only games I have that take advantage of 3-d on linux are Quake 3 and RtCW.</p>

Attention Emacs users. It took me a while to realize that new-style fonts can be enabled by adding this to the ~/.emacs file.

    (set-face-attribute 'default
      nil :font "Monospace-11")

So here's how I set up the look of Emacs in my .emacs:

    (require 'color-theme)
    (color-theme-dark-laptop)
    (set-scroll-bar-mode 'right)
    (tool-bar-mode nil)
    (menu-bar-mode nil)
    (set-face-attribute 'default
      nil :font "Monospace-11")

And here's my emacs startup script:

    #!/bin/sh
    #DTPD#
    # ${HOME}/bin/e
    if test "$DISPLAY" ; then
      nohup /usr/bin/emacsclient \
        -a '' -n  "$@" \
        > /dev/null 2>&1 &
    else
      exec /usr/bin/emacs "$@"
    fi

This startes emacs in daemon mode if it's not already running (there's not a lot of harm in leaving a daemon going in the background all the time) and then the client tell the daemon to spawn a new window to open the files mentioned in the command-line arguments. The "nohup" part deparents the server so you don't get error messages hitting your console.

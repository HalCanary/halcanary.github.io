Happy Solstice! At 7-something (CST) this morining, the north pole pointed as far away from Sol as gets.

And it snowed last night. I've been looking out my window every morning, checking for snow, wondering when it will finally stick to the ground. No more waiting.

And I expct a blizzard the day I get back to Madison from FL. That would be the 30th. You can go ahead and mark your calendars. There is **always** a snowstorm whenever I travel northwards in wintertime.

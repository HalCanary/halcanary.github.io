<p>The last two books I read, <em>Fallen Dragon</em>, by Peter F. Hamilton and <em>Survivor</em>, by Chuck Palhaniuk have a few things in common.</p>
<p>I read both in one sitting. This seems to be the only way for me to apprach anything these days. If I can't finish it in one go, it gets put aside as soon as I seen another shiny thing.</p>
<p>The protaganists in each book are programmed to behave in ways that benefit their families, but each finds a way to break out. Lawrence Newton travels back in time to help himself run away from home; Tender Branson does not kill himself, and later his twin brother tries to break the rest of his programming.</p>
<p>Both get involved with evil corporations once they enter the real world: Newton becomes a corporate space pirate, and Branson becomes a TV evangelist.</p>
<p>And there's the theme of the transforming nature of sex. Both Newton's father and Branson's brother try to use sex to change them.</p>
<p><strong>Coincidence, or special sauce?</strong></p>
<p>I could turn this into a nice three paragraph essay, suitable for a 10th grade english class, but I won't.</p>

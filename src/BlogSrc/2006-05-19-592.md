GIYF. Going [here](http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html) skips the player detection. Then one can simply strip the URL from the Page Info dialog, the way God intended.

**More background:** I use Fedora Linux as my main OS on my desktop. I have several media players installed---Mplayer, Xine, Realplayer, Ogle, Totem. Some of them will play windows-media-video files without a hitch. The fools who wrote the cnn website assumed that ONLY Windows Media Player would be able to play such files. Jackass.

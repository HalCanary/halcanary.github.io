I got my Kill-A-Watt electricity usage monitor in the mail today. So far I have discovered:

1) When completely powered off, the computer power supply and the television consume 5 watts each.

2) The computer speakers/subwoofer consumes around seven watts if the power is off and around seven watts if the power is on.

3) The 19 inch LCD monitor consumes very little power when off and around 26 watts when on. (Most of which is radiated as visible light.)

4) The CPU consumes around 99 watts when running smoothly and not spinning the drives much.

<p>I should blog something interesting about my life, but I am busy living. I'm working on a school assignment having to do with applying algorithms to graph theory.  The grad-level graph theory class I failed comes in handy there.  I'm going to go hang out with friends in a few minutes. Work is still there; the days are just as long as ever, and the constant barrage of paper-cuts is bothering me today.</p>

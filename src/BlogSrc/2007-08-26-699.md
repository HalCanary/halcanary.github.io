I saw the headline “[Greek Fires Kill 12 and Threaten Antiquities](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/world/europe/27greece.html)” and thought it said “[Greek Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Fire) Kills 12 and Threatens Antiquities.”

Which would have been equally sad but at the same time, very cool.

I'm pretty happy with my current recipe for Miso soup.

Serves 1.

*   0.5 tsp Dashi (I've got Hon-dashi, which is a bonito broth.)
*   2 Green Onions
*   1 tsp Miso Paste (I have Yamabuki Tezukuri Miso.)

Put a bowlful of water into a small pot. Heat to boiling. Cut the green onions up and throw them in. If you let them cook for a little while I think they add more flavor. Throw the dashi in as soon as it begins to boil. Add the miso next and turn off the heat. Stir. As soon as the miso is disolved, serve. Overcooking the miso or dashi will destroy those flavors.

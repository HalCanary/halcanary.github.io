<p>If you plug a usb device that's not working just right into a hub, or vice-versa (a working device into a misconfigured hub), you will destroy something every time.  I just lost my usb keyboard/hub that way.  A few years ago, I lost a usb joystick.</p>
<p>I pulled out my old AT keyboard.  Clickety Clack!</p>

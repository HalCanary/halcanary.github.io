<p>Here's your basic shish-kabob, using my favorite general-purpose meat: chicken.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take your chicken breasts out of the freezer. Cut each breast into aprroximately six equal-sized chunks. Marinate in a lot of black pepper, lemon pepper, some random herbs from your garden, and the chicken's own juices.</li>
<li>Wait 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cut up a several bell peppers of different colors into 8-12 large pieces. (Remember that non-green bell peppers are more expensive, so you don't have to buy more than one token pepper of each color.)</li>
<li>Cut an onion up into little pieces.</li>
<li>Also have little tomatoes and mushrooms.</li>
<li>Invite your guests to build thier own kabobs. Audience paricipation makes everything more fun. Differenciate your kabobs by having different items on the ends.</li>
<li>Grill over hot charcoals until meat is nolonger raw and veggies are well burnt. Don't forget to rotate and flip.</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

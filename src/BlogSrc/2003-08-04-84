Here's your basic shish-kabob, using my favorite general-purpose meat: chicken.

1.  Take your chicken breasts out of the freezer. Cut each breast into aprroximately six equal-sized chunks. Marinate in a lot of black pepper, lemon pepper, some random herbs from your garden, and the chicken's own juices.
2.  Wait 24 hours.
3.  Cut up a several bell peppers of different colors into 8-12 large pieces. (Remember that non-green bell peppers are more expensive, so you don't have to buy more than one token pepper of each color.)
4.  Cut an onion up into little pieces.
5.  Also have little tomatoes and mushrooms.
6.  Invite your guests to build thier own kabobs. Audience paricipation makes everything more fun. Differenciate your kabobs by having different items on the ends.
7.  Grill over hot charcoals until meat is nolonger raw and veggies are well burnt. Don't forget to rotate and flip.
8.  Enjoy.

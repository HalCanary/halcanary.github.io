<p>I just made chili for the first time in my life.  I didn't even try to follow a recipe, I just started with a canonical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne#Vegetarian_chili_.28also_known_as_chili_sin_carne.2C_.22without_meat.22.29">chili sin carne</a>, but I couldn't help but make changes to the recipe as I went along.  I added an extra bell pepper, because I like them a lot, and I added a bit of tofu, but not enought that you notice it.  And I increased the amount of chili powder until I could taste it; then I added some more.<br />

<strong>UPDATE 2005-03-01</strong></p>
<p>Here is my mother's recipe:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Veggie Chili</strong></p>
<p>makes 8 1-cup servings</p>
<p>ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>2 bell peppers - diced</li>
<li>1 medium onion - chopped</li>
<li>2 t olive oil</li>
<li>12 ounces soy/meat alternative crumbles</li>
<li>1 T chili powder ( or more to taste)</li>
<li>1 t ground cumin</li>
<li>1 4 ounce can chopped green chilies</li>
<li>1 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can black beans, drained</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can kidney beans, drained</li>
<li>1 15 ounce can tomato sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would make the following alterations:  use four ounces of tofu and a bunch of lentils.  Use fresh tomatos instead of sauce. Double or triple the chili powder.</p>

Exactly how much entropy do we get?

Each character can be a z or a Z with a probability of 2/64 for each. The other 60 characters have a probability of 1/64 each. Apply the formula:

    information entropy
        = ∑(i=1, n, p(x[i]) log2(1 / p(x[i])))
        = ∑(i=1, 2, 2/64 *  log2(64/2)) + ∑(i=1, 60, 1/64 * log2(64/1))
        = 2 * (2/64) * log2(64/2) + 60 * (1/64) * log2(64/1)
        = 2 * (2/64) * 5 + 60 * 1/64 * 6
        = 20/64 + 360/64
        = 380/64
        = 5.9375

Mulitply by 24 for 24 characters, and get 142.5 bits of entropy.

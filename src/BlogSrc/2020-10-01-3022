SUMMARY=summary of last few years of site changes.

I now host this site on Github, since it is free and fairly easy for me to use.
I push the new version of the site with a simple `git push`.  I only pay for my
domain name.

I am still using the same blog builder Python script I wrote years ago, but
I've refactored it a dozen times.  I also use a similar script to rebuild
static pages from markdown source too.

Other changes:

-   Colors are either default or white-on-black for dark mode.  Information
    that I used to de-emphasize with grey-on-white text is now put in a
    box.

-   Switch from original-flavor Markdown to CommonMark.  Allows me to put
    markdown inside a `<div>`. For example:
    
    ```
    <div id="foobar" style="display:none;">

    > Foo
    > Bar

    </div>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('foobar')
                             .style
                             .display = 'block';">
    SHOW
    </button>
    ```

-   Reduce extra resources needed by a page:
    -   The `<link rel="icon">` is now a `data:` URL.
    -   I inline all CSS.
    -   I also inline a SVG version of my written name on the static pages as a banner.
        Effort was made to minimize the size.  By vectorizing what was
        originally a scanned image, it is much smaller and looks really good on
        high-dpi screens.

-   Starting to try to meet accessibility standards.

-   Replace `<a href="" onlick="....">` with `<button>`, since that is less of
    an abuse of html.  It is more clear to the user that clicking that will
    change something on the page, not go to a new page.

-   Remove extraneous content from main page.

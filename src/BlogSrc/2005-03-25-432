<blockquote><p>"Agashiel," Pat [Sajak] began and did his best to sound friendly and at ease. "I am told you are the psycho-physical manifestation of human nightmares. You must not get a lot of sleep."</p>
<p>The grotesque flesh-marionettes of the studio audience erupted with a shrill and uneven staccato of laughter.</p>
<p>"You make your residence in the ephemeral substance of slumbering fear and as long as at least one human is paralyzed with terror you will always have a home to return to."</p>
<p>A susurration of confluent rivers of paranoia, horror, and despair emerged from Agashiel's rictus mask and formed a prickling approximation of English.</p>
<p>"The sweet meat dreams of me." Agashiel intoned. "Dreams of me."</p>
<p>He reached out as though to caress Pat Sajak's face but the host was wise enough to pull away. The audience laughed even more enthusiastically than before. </p>

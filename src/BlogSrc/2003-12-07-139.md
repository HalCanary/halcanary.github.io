I went through and made a bunch of changes to wohc this weekend. First, I finally switched over to movable type. Then I marked all code on the site with a suitable license. Then I added a [FAQ](https://halcanary.org/p/faq/) and [site map](https://halcanary.org/p/sitemap/).

**Wonderfully** wasted time.

The neighbors have stopped playing <em>OK Computer</em> through the wall. And I just finished Robert Charles Wilson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812545249/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>Chronoliths</em></a>.</p>
<p>The Plot is similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765309386/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>Spin</em></a>.  Un-understandable cosmic event effects the life of Johnny Everyman, along with the rest of the planet.  Eventually, decades later, we find out what the hell happened.  Character developnent ensues.</p>
<p>What intersts me is that <em>The Chronoliths</em> plugs directly into this century's zeitgeist, even though it was published in August 2001.</p>

<p>I am a little worried that the two of RCW's books I've read have similar plots and themes.  But then again, most authors do that.</p>

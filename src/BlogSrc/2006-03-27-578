<p>A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Alicia Ashman Branch of the Madison Public Library (733 N High Point Rd). Man, it was rich. Expensive wooden shelves. Wood trim everywhere. Lots of space.</p>
<p>Compare to my local branch. Small, dingy. In the summertime, full of kids, waiting in lines for a computer.</p>
<p>The Hawthorn Branch on East Wash was almost as nice as the High Point branch. My local library is the South Madison branch on Park St.</p>

A proposal for a better calendar. (If we didn't have the Gregorian calendar
already and wanted to start from scratch.)

    No      Name            Days
    --      ----            ----
    01      January         30
    02      February        31
    03      March           30
    04      April           31
    05      May             30
    06      June            31
    07      July            30
    08      August          31
    09      September       30
    10      October         31
    11      November        30
    12      December        30 or 31

This would space out the months more equitably. Almost all two-month periods
would be exactly 61 days, the exception being December in non-leap years.

I would define January 1 to be the day after the Winter Solstice (at a fixed
zero meridian). So all dates would be around ten days off from the Gregorain
calendar.

As a result of this rule there would be around 8 leap days every 33 years,
similar to how the Iranian/Persian/Jalālī Calendar works.

Of course the final calendar we will all come to accept millennia from now will
probably simply be
[TAI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time) with picosecond
precision, expressed as a number of seconds since some [fixed
instant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_%28reference_date%29). Then
calculating intervals become trivially simple, and we will just ignore where
the sun is.

* * *

Additional, optional rules to make this a perpetual calendar: January 1 is
always a Saturday. Then on 365-day years, you would get two Saturdays in a row:

    12-29 12-30 | 01-01 01-02 01-03
     Fri   Sat  |  Sat   Sun   Mon

Or a double weekend on leap years:

    12-29 12-30 12-31 | 01-01 01-02 01-03
     Fri   Sat   Sun  |  Sat   Sun   Mon

<div class="box">

Note that one could make the existing Gregorian Calendar into a perpetual
calendar by defining March 1 as always a Saturday.

    02-27 02-28 | 03-01 03-02 03-03
     Fri   Sat  |  Sat   Sun   Mon

    02-27 02-28 02-29 | 03-01 03-02 03-03
     Fri   Sat   Sun  |  Sat   Sun   Mon

</div>

**UPDATE 2008-10-25:** Here's very simple python code to give the month, day,
and week, given the day of year.

    # returns (month, day-of-month, weekday)
    # given day-of-year
    def dayandmonth(yday):
        assert (yday > 0) and (yday < 367)
        da = ((yday - 1) % 61) + 1
        mo = (((yday - 1) // 61 ) * 2) + 1
        if (da > 30):
            da = da - 30
            mo = mo + 1
        wd = (yday - 1) % 7 +1
        return (mo, da, wd)

And a leap year function:

    # offset is determined by solar
    # observations at the reference
    # longitude
    def isleapyear2(y, offset=6):
        n = (y + offset) % 33
        return n and not (n % 4)

Every 10,000 years, the offset may need to be changed. After 100,000 years, a
new algorithm will likely be necessary

**UPDATE 2020-04-22:**

Here's another common option for a perpetual calendar.  Insert one or two
non-weekdays into the year.  With this option, each quarter is always exactly
13 weeks, and starts on a Sunday.  Many businesses use a [4–4–5
calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-4-5_calendar) because this property
is so convienent.

    No   Name         Days     Starts With  Quarter
    --   ----         ----     -----------  -------
    01   January      30       Sunday       QⅠ
    02   February     31       Tuesday
    03   March        30       Friday

    04   April        31       Sunday      	QⅡ
    05   May          30       Wednesday
    06   June         31       Friday

         [June 31 is not a weekday]

    07   July         30       Sunday       QⅢ
    08   August       31       Tuesday
    09   September    30       Friday

    10   October      31       Sunday       QⅣ
    11   November     30       Wednesday
    12   December     30 or 31 Friday

         [December 31 is not a weekday]

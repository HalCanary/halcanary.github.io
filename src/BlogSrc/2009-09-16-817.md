I wanted to access my desktop's music library from my living room and play it through the amplifier and speakers there. So I grabbed my netbook, and after fumbling around with NFS for too long, I just tried:

    yum install sshfs

(It's a OLPC XO-1, so it's Redhat-based.) And then wrote a little script:

    #!/bin/sh
    ## ~/bin/mount-music
    mkdir -p "${HOME}/music"
    sshfs hal@sloop:/d/music "${HOME}/music"

I installed mpg123-alsa (by the simple expedient of copying the executable) and wrote a little script to run it.

    #!/bin/sh
    test -f "${HOME}/music/index.txt" || \
        sshfs hal@sloop:/d/music "${HOME}/music"
    cd "${HOME}/music"
    exec mpg123-alsa --control --long-tag \
        --shuffle --list index.txt

And index.txt is a file created with the find command on the server:

    #!/bin/sh
    # run this script to refresh the index file.
    cd $HOME/music
    find . -type f -a -name '*.mp3' > index.txt

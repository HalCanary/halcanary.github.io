Right now I'm not buying new books because i'm in super-thrifty mode. (I did, however buy a new compass (a [Brunton 26DNL](http://www.brunton.com/product.php?id=92)) that floats for my next kayacking trip. Not that it is easy to get lost when you are on a river. You're either going upstream or downstream. I bame the DVDs of _Lost_.) One book that I'm not buying due to the moratorium on new books is _The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster_ (ISBN 0812976568).

Inside the _Gospel_ are the [The Eight "I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_of_the_Flying_Spaghetti_Monster#Captain_Mosey_and_the_Eight_.22I.27d_Really_Rather_You_Didn.27ts.22), commandments for Pastafarians. I especially like number 5:

> **5.** I'd Really Rather You Didn't Challenge The Bigoted, Misogynist, Hateful Ideas Of Others On An Empty Stomach. Eat, Then Go After The Bastard.

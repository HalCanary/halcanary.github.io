I just made chili for the first time in my life. I didn't even try to follow a recipe, I just started with a canonical [chili sin carne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne#Vegetarian_chili_.28also_known_as_chili_sin_carne.2C_.22without_meat.22.29), but I couldn't help but make changes to the recipe as I went along. I added an extra bell pepper, because I like them a lot, and I added a bit of tofu, but not enought that you notice it. And I increased the amount of chili powder until I could taste it; then I added some more.  
  
**UPDATE 2005-03-01**

Here is my mother's recipe:

> **Veggie Chili**
> 
> makes 8 1-cup servings
> 
> ingredients
> 
> *   2 bell peppers - diced
> *   1 medium onion - chopped
> *   2 t olive oil
> *   12 ounces soy/meat alternative crumbles
> *   1 T chili powder ( or more to taste)
> *   1 t ground cumin
> *   1 4 ounce can chopped green chilies
> *   1 14.5 ounce can diced tomatoes
> *   1 15 ounce can black beans, drained
> *   1 15 ounce can kidney beans, drained
> *   1 15 ounce can tomato sauce
> 
> Bring to a boil and simmer 30 minutes.

I would make the following alterations: use four ounces of tofu and a bunch of lentils. Use fresh tomatos instead of sauce. Double or triple the chili powder.

<p>I got the style preferences to work under IE6. I still don't know why it was crashing, though. The fix is a bit of a kludge.</p>
<p>Was bored this morning, so I went to church. They altered the prayers of the people. The new version:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We pray that our leaders may govern with humility,<br /> that they not be full of selfish ambition or conceit... </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old version (form I):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For our President, for the leaders of the nations,<br />and for all in authority, let us pray to the Lord.<br />Lord, have mercy.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of the change. I think somebody's saying that our leaders are more evil today and that we no longer want the Lord to have mercy for them.</p>

<p>"Just as <em>you suspected</em>, Barack Obama is <em>wrong for you</em>." --John McCain radio ad, heard in FLorida.</p>
<p>Think about this for a while.  Why might someone be <b>suspicious</b> of Obama?  Maybe they don't want to admit out lout that that are afraid of black men.  And the "for you" bit:  this ties into a segregationist viewpoint where it's okay if Obama wants to be president of black America, but not okay if he wants to be president of <b>you</b>, white America.  In fact, it would be <b>wrong</b> for a black man to be president of <b>you</b>.</p>
<p>It's subtle, though.</p>

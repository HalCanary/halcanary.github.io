I just read Ken MacLeod's [_The Cassini Division_](/isbn/?0812568583) today. It was good enough for me to finish in a day. It makes me think. Why the hell do we pay people to serve us drinks? I can make my own drinks, thank you! I'll pay for the materiel, but emplying somebody just seems like make-work.

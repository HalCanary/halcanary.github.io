A fool and his money are soon parted. I, on the hand, felt that the economy needed stimulating. So I bought a new sub-notebook computer. It's a Sony VAIO PCG-SRX87 (not to be confused with a Swarny WOW). I meant to install linux on it as soon as possible, but soon gave up, seeing as the install program failed to recognize either my DVD drive or hard drive.

So instead, I installed a lot of cygwin stuff on top of XP. I'm using windowmaker on xfree86 on cygwin.

Now I have five different ways to connect to the internet from the notebook.

1.  Dialing in to my isp.
2.  Dialing into work.
3.  Wired ethernet to wherever.
4.  Wireless ehternet where I can find it. (I've been moderately successful with this. Mark's house has wireless, it worked there. I've also found a signal at the Memorial Union, although I couldn't get the authentication to work. The other day, I found an open network from the stifskeller. I am tempted to chalk it, but that might be considered graphiti when you do it on the inside of a building. I think a better thing to do would be to get out my pocket knife and carve the warmark into the table. Then noone would notice. )
5.  Wireless ethernet to connect to my desktop. Then ssh into the desktop, start the ppp conection remotely, and use X11 forwarding to run browser remotely.

I started reading the [Anarchy FAQ](http://www.diy-punk.org/anarchy/) the other day. In order for me to be an anarchist, someone is going to have to show me that a 100% anarchist society would work. On the other hand, I do believe that anarchy works in certain situations. I'd like to see the internet become even less organized. We shouldn't rely so much on DNS. **DNS is not the internet.**

The reason I'm thinking about this is that I'd like to see someone organize a wireless cooperative in this city. The idea is to buy bandwidth in bulk and distribute it throughout the city using cheap wireless hardware.

A while back I purchased a subscriotion to [Salon](http://salon.com). So far, I'm happy with it. It's better than most newspapers that I've ever subscribed to. Especially considering how much I hate killing trees just to print up boring sports scores or 14 hour old stock prices.

<p>I was confused by  <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3843114">this </a> story this morning.  It would seem that William Gibson (1914-) is not the same person as William Gibson (1948-), even though they are both writers.</p>
<p>I must admit, I've never managed to get through a Gibson novel anyways, so why would I care?</p>

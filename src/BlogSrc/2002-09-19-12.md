Last weekend, I picked up a couple of O'Reilly books at the store: _JavaScript: The Definitive Guide_ by David Flanagan, and _Programming Perl_ (the camel book) by Larry Wall, et all.

I've found that JavaScript (js) is a much easier to grok if you think of it as a real language. And there's a lot of cool things that can be done with the W3C DOM.

Perl, on the other hand, is cool, but it's syntax is too complicated. A comparason is in order. YOu can learn all there is to know about Java's syntax in a short time, but it would take years of effort to lean everything that can be done with the language. With Perl, it takes a long time to grok the eccentricies of the syntax, but as soon as you do, you know how to do anything with the language.

Is there a word for this concept? I guess that Java is a minimalistic OOP language, while Perl is a maxamalistic language that allows OOP structures. As a logician, I hate Perl. As a hacker, I have a lot of respect for anyone who has mastered it.

I've played a bit with js and cookies. See [the prefs page](preferences.cgi).

I've been taking photos. See [this](/p/a40/), [this](/p/photo-2002-08-25/), and [that](/p/photo-2002-08-31/).

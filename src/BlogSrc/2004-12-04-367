<p><em>From my personal diary, 2004-09-12 Sunday 23:24:02:</em></p>
<p>"What is science?"  This question is my answer to the questions posed to me recently and independently by two people.  They mention "supernatural" things and dare me to refute them.  I will not.</p>
<p>Science is a methodology.</p>
<ul>
<li>	Repeatability.	</li>
<li>	Mathematical Modeling.	</li>
<li>	Least Hypothesis.	</li>
<li>	More?	</li>
</ul>
<p>What if there are aspects of nature that are not tractable by the methods of science?  Would science be able to say anything at all about them?</p>
<p>What we <strong>do</strong> know is that the vast  majority of nature is aproachable with the methods of science. I would have to invoke &ldquo;least hypothesis&rdquo; to say that all of nature is like that.  Bit of a liar's paradox, there?</p>

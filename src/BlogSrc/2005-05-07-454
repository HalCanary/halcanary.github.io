<p>You may or may not have noticed that I have started cross-posting a subset of the WoHC Log to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22hal+canary%22+site%3Alivejournal.com">Livejournal.</a>  There are a lot of people who simply refuse to read or comment on a post that isn't on Lj.  Some of these people are my friends.  I guess that's why I have gaim set up for four different accounts on four different instant messaging protocols (jabber/icq/aim/yahoo).</p>
<p>Some topics will not be cross-posted.  In general, the more geeky a subject is, the less likely it is to be cross-posted.</p>

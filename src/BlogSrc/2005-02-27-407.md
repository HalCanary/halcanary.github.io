English is so versatile, no wonder it will replace all other languages within a century. Yeah, English!

> Because of its profane status and versatility, the word "fuck" can be used many times in an English sentence. For example,
> 
> *   "Fucking _fuck_ those fucking fuckers!" ("Forget about those very disliked people.")
> *   "Fucking fucker's fucking fucked!" ("It is broken.")
> 
> The latter example excellently demonstrates the versitility of the word fuck, as each instance represents a different syntactical usage: an article, a noun, a present participle (to is), and an adjective.

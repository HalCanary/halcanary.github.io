I listented to a couple of good things on the radio and the internet recently. (This morning's _To the Best of Our Knowledge_ and [this](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail554.html)) The drawback of hearing really good things is that it's more difficult to cut-and-paste or bookmark really good quotations.

When reading, you can go back and re-read the interesting parts.

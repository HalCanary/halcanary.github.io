<p>By the way, any of my friends who want to use this space to blog are welcome. One caveat, though: I'm not hosting any static files. </p>
<p>I'm also going to streamline [s]ome of the back-engine of the site, too. Stop using cookies+ecmascript to do the stylesheet changes, instead just specify a few alternate stylesheets. I've already moved the blog submission form to a htaccess-controlled directory.</p>

<p>I saw the headline &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/world/europe/27greece.html">Greek Fires Kill 12 and Threaten Antiquities</a>&rdquo; and thought it said &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Fire">Greek Fire</a> Kills 12 and Threatens Antiquities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which would have been equally sad but at the same time, very cool.</p>

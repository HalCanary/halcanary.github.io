<p>Mark said some things the other day that I didn't respond to because I was drunk. Here we go:</p>
<p>General Platonism is the belief that there exist transcendent truths. That's it. Nothing more here. One of these truths is  &ldquo;(ZFC)=&gt;(1+2=3)&rdquo;. I won't even comment on whether or not ZFC is true. </p>
<p>So, to conclude, General Platonism is a belief, yes, but it cannot be considered a religion.</p>

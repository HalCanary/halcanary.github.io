I got a package from the folks today. It contained a few xeroxed articles and, strangely, two seven-inch sticks of bamboo. "Bamboo? What the huh?" I thought, then rushed out the door to work.

This evening, I bothered looking through the articles. The bamboo, it seems, is the answer to a question I had asked Mom about ink+watercolors drawings. According to the article (Mom didn't give me a proper reference):

> The 'pen' I use is generally a matchstick thrust into a short length of bamboo, which I then sharpen with a razor blade or craft knife---the actual shape is the one that works best in a situation...

Ah ha. I need to pick up some india ink.

I had originally asked her: how do I draw [this](http://melvinmiller.com/6-6-76%20Pabst%20Brewery~02.JPG).

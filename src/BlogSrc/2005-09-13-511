<p>I got a package from the folks today.  It contained a few xeroxed articles and, strangely, two seven-inch sticks of bamboo.  "Bamboo? What the huh?" I thought, then rushed out the door to work.</p>
<p>This evening, I bothered looking through the articles.  The bamboo, it seems, is the answer to a question I had asked Mom about ink+watercolors drawings.  According to the article (Mom didn't give me a proper reference):</p>
<blockquote><p>The 'pen' I use is generally a matchstick thrust into a short length of bamboo, which I then sharpen with a razor blade or craft knife---the actual shape is the one that works best in a situation... </p>

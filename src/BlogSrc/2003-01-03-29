<p><strong>Other News</strong>: There is strangeness afoot in Madison; there is no snow yet. Am not handling unemployment bordom well. Need to listen to Handel louder.</p>
<p>Went to the local branch library and picked up some CDs. Especially cool is the Academy of Ancient Music playing Handel. Goal here is to not buy another CD in the next 6 months.</p>

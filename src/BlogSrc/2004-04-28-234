<p>The weather is so nice that I'd like to go work outside, but alas, my <a href="/p/vaio/">notebook</a>'s screen was cracked last fall.  I think I might look into finding a replacement screen soon, so that I can go work outside.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'd like to try the 2.6 kernel on that thing.  Mabe 2.6 works better.</p>

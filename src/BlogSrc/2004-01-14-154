<blockquote><p>Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.</p>

<p>I am fast aproaching my twenty-sixth birthday.  I may even die someday.  Scary thought.  I <strong>could</strong> become a badass hero-type.  I just lack proper motivation.</p>

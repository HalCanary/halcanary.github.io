<p>I got into an argument with the physics geeks (term used affectionately; I used to be a physics geek) today.  I objected to the assumtion that the term &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; implied a belief in the literal interpretation of the book of Revelation, among other things.</p>
<p>Kids today are absolutists.  Being a Christian means this.  Being an Anarchist means that.  This band is cool.  That band sucks.</p>

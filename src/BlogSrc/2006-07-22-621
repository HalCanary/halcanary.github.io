<p><strong>New movies I want to see:</strong></p>
<p><em>A Scanner Darkly</em> — I am not a big PKD fan, but I have never failed to enjoy a Philip K. Dick movie adaption (Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall, Paycheck).</p>
<p><em>Clerks II</em> — Guilty pleasure.  I can probably wait for this to come out on DVD, but if I get bored, I might catch it in the theater.</p>
<p><em>My Super Ex-Girlfriend</em> — This looks bad, but it might be good.  </p>
<p><strong>Movies I've seen so far this summer:</strong></p>
<p><em>X-Men 3</em> — The new director did not do nearly as badly as he could have done.</p>
<p><em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> — Definitely worth seeing.  If you are unwilling to shell out a few dollars for a ticket, you can <a href="http://climatechangeaction.blogspot.com/2006/04/video-of-week-al-gore-inconvenient_28.html">download the presentation itself.</a></p>
<p><em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> — This was a really slow movie that didn't really go anywhere.</p>
<p><em>Superman Returns</em> — It felt like a Superman movie.  That's all I really wanted from this one.</p>
<p><em>Dead Man's Chest</em> — In adventure stories, the coin of the realm is strangeness.  Think of the Barsoom stories.</p>

<p>I was browsing through a best-selling book on veganism that doesn't use the word vegan at all (Skinny Bitch, isbn:0762424931) and it got me thinking that maybe I should at least try to give up milk for a week. So I bought soymilk and put it on my cereal for a while.</p>
<p>I still find the stuff bland and tasteless. A poor substitute.</p>
<p>And it's more expensive than milk. If the dairy industry had no subsidies, then I expect milk would cost more than soymilk. Then I would think about switching, just to save money.</p>
<p>Odd how government policy encourages bad diet choices.</p>

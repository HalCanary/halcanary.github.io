Dan Simmons (of _Hyperion_ fame) has written [his take on the _Iliad_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380978938/theworldofhalcan/). I did not buy the book when I saw it in the store, because I've been wasting too much money recently anyway, but I put it on hold at [the public library](http://madison.scls.lib.wi.us/).

I always wanted to write a modern retelling of the _Iliad_, either a novel or a rock opera, but both would be out of reach of my skill.

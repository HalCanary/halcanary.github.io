<blockquote><p>Whenever I hear them use the word "freedom" now, I mentally substitute the word "oil," and suddenly the sentence is translated into perfect sense: "Oil is on the march," "The terrorists hate our oil," "Our heroic troops have paid the ultimate price for oil," "Oil isn't free," etc.</p>

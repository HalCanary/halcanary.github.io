I was confused by [this](http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3843114) story this morning. It would seem that William Gibson (1914-) is not the same person as William Gibson (1948-), even though they are both writers.

I must admit, I've never managed to get through a Gibson novel anyways, so why would I care?

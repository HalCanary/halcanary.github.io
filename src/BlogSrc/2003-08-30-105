<p>&ldquo;Why does technology make me so excited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn't make any sene me. Technology is just a tool.  Is a paintbrush cool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it's a really nice painbrush, yes. Do you think only ideas  are interesting, not things? I see computers as instantiations of  really neat Platonic forms. Everything is an idea.&rdquo;</p>

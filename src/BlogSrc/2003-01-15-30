<p>Things i think should be illegal: </p>
<ol>
<li>Filters on cigarettes. They don't biodegrade, and smokers know    that they are killing themselves, even with the filter.</li>
<li>Gas powered recreational boats. Again, it's an environmental    issue.  Sailboats are more fun, anyways.</li>
<li>Software patents.</li>
</ol>

xmms was giving me some crap the other day, so I gave up on it, again.

    
    #!/bin/sh
    ## $HOME/bin/playmusic ##
    
    FILE="$HOME/music-file.txt"
    M="$HOME/Music"
    
    echo -n "" > $FILE
    cd $M
    for x in */*.mp3 ; do
        echo $M/$x >> $FILE
    done
    for x in */*/*.mp3 ; do
        echo $M/$x >> $FILE
    done
    for x in */*/*/*.mp3 ; do
        echo $M/$x >> $FILE
    done
    
    echo mpg123 -z --list $FILE
    exec mpg123 -z --list $FILE
    

**UPDATE 2007-06-28:** [`find` is a lot better than this wildcard stuff](/vv/2006/11/23/665/).

>   Incorrect. Those actions are copyright infringement, not theft. Theft involves
>   taking something from its owner, with the intent to deprive them of it. When
>   you make infringing copies you are taking something, but not depriving anyone
>   else of it.

>   Agreed. Just don't apply labels that don't fit. "Theft" has legal and moral
>   meanings that don't apply to copyright infringement. Copyright infringement is
>   a crime, and although it doesn't deprive anyone of anything, it does violate an
>   important social contract, so what it is is enough, without calling it
>   something else.

>   >   If you don't "wanna pay for it", and the creator hasn't told you it's free for

>   More precisely, we as a society have decided that to give up that right,
>   mostly, for a time, in order to promote the publication of more works. We as
>   individuals should understand and honor this choice, because it's a good one.
>   Again, though, don't make the mistake of assuming that the author of a work has
>   some natural right to control the work. The only natural right the author has
>   is to decide whether or not to create it, and whether or not to publish it.
>   Everything after that is a legal fiction (for a good reason).

<p>These are my new spamassassin rules.  If your configured email client fails to have a valid DKIM or DK signature or SPF record, I'm probably going to mark you as spam.</p>
<pre>
#### .spamassassin/user_prefs
required_score -1.0
score DKIM_VALID_AU -10.0
score SPF_PASS -5.0
</pre>
<p>99% of my legitimate correspondents are okay already.</p>

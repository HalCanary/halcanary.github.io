SUMMARY=A list of things that we should be seriously working on

  - Clarify and extend meaning of "republican form of government" in Article Four:

      * Affirmative right to vote and access to voting systems for all adult citizens.

      * Secure, transparent, secret ballot voting systems with independent statistical tests for accuracy.

      * Automatic, non-partisan electoral districting with the algorithm spelled out. (E.g.: Districts must be equal in population to within 0.5% and maximally compact (for some given definition of compact.))

  - Eliminate Electoral College; all adult US citizens directly vote for President and Vice President, regardless of where they live.

  - Uniform rules for election of elected federal officials (President, VP, Senators, Representatives):

      * Nonpartisan ranked-voting primaries for elected federal offices, to happen a fixed amount of time before the general election.  Primary elections eliminate all but two candidates for office using instant-runoff rules.

      * Uniform rules for getting onto the primary ballot via a standardized petition process.  Limit on number of primary candidates, with priority given to those with the most petition signatures.

  - Clarify that non-person legal entities are not people.  The rights protected by the Constitution are the rights of natural persons only.

  - Federal elected officials must use a true blind trust.

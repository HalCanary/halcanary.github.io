<p>If you have problems getting your .htaccess files working, don't forget to insert  "<code>AllowOverride All</code>" into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.</p>
<p>I've been having fun with  mod_rewrite.  For example:</p>
<pre>
## public_html/archives/.htaccess
## from halcanary.org
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase   /
RewriteRule ^cat$ /archives/cat.php [L]
## EOF
</pre>
<p>So <a href="/archives/cat"><code>/archives/cat</code></a> is just a pointer to <a href="/archives/cat.php"><code>/archives/cat.php</code></a>.</p>
<p>The whole <code>/p/*</code> directory is just a pointer to a single php script.</p>

<p>The last few days I've felt amazingly <strong>good</strong>.  I've been waking up early, around 08:00 or 09:00, getting the right amount of caffeine (2L of DC are $.89 at Woodman's this week.), and sleeping nine or ten hours a day.  The down side is that I've been falling asleep right after work every night.</p>
<p>It's nice not to sleep through most of the nine-hour day.</p>
<p>I may even finish cleaning the Fortress of Solitude today.</p>

<p>Driving around in the snow last night was stressful.  Maybe I'll get used to it.  But I had no mishaps.</p>

<p>I'm going to wait until it warms up a few more degrees before I go outside and change the headlight on the car.</p>

<p>How could you ever use a text editor without the downcase-word, upcase-word, and capitalize-word functions?  In Emacs it's Alt-l, Alt-u, and Alt-c.</p>

Dean has promised that he'll drop out if he loses Wisconsin.

Conversely, he has indicated that he'll stay in **until** Wisconsin.

That mean that there will be at least two candidates left on the ballot by the time I get to vote. I'm releaved. At the rate they were dropping out, I figured that there'll be no choice left by the 17th.

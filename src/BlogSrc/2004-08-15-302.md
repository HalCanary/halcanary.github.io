In the last three years, I have rented maybe one movie on VHS. The only reason I keep my VHS player is to play my original-edition _Star Wars_ trilogy (which will never be availible on DVD).

I've been striving to simplify my system. I'm getting close to the ideal:

Gone are:

*   Tape deck
*   VHS (It can be plugged into the TV if I need it.)
*   DVD player
*   CD player

I would someday like to replace my big computer case with a tiny [Shuttle](http://us.shuttle.com/) computer, my CRT TV with either a LCD screen or a projector, and my amplifier with something smaller.

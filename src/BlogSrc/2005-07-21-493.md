Recently, I've noticed a trend in TV scifi. Helmets on pressure suits don't have headlamps on the outside, they have lamps on the **inside** of the helmet, illuminating the face.

This makes sense from a TV point of view: You can tell who is in the suit. But in reality, a bright light inside the suit would turn the faceplate into a mirror. The actors can't see a thing.

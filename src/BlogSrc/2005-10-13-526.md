> Last week I was reading an article about Miers' main qualification as a Supreme Court nominee being, as it is with all Bush appointees, personal loyalty to the president. This criteria makes a Machiavellian sort of sense when applied to cronies you're going to make cabinet secretaries or bureau chiefs, but I couldn't figure out why you'd require personal loyalty from someone you were selecting for a lifetime appointment... _unless_, I realized, you _also_ intended to be in office for life. That's when I realized: they have no intention of leaving office. No way in hell are they taking any chance of losing an election with some other candidate. They are entrenched in the White House for good.

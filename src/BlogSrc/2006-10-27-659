<blockquote><p>Some segments of the Linux user community, which prefer to avoid the IP-encumbered ATI drivers due to ideological choices, still prefer the R200-based chips, as they are among the fastest modern video cards with stable open source drivers.

<p>My ATI RV280 Radeon 9200 works great with The new Compiz window manager that comes with Fedora Core 6.  Using the <code>desktop-effects</code> program, you can replace the old window manager (Metacity) with Compiz.  Compiz makes use of neat effects such as the spinning cube and the scaler plugin (similar to OSX's expos&eacute;).</p>
<p>For once, something just works.</p>

<p>Compiz has more options.  It's a bit of a kludge ot change them.</p>

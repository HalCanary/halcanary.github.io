![[cover]](/images/book-building-moon.jpg)I picked up Larry Niven and Brenda Cooper's [_Building Harlequin's Moon_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765312662/ref%3Dnosim/theworldofhalcan/). I'm only a third of the way through it.

Impressions:

1.  It reminds me a bit of the brainstorming I was doing the other week, without the aliens.
2.  It sets up a situation where you can _almost_ understand why people create an abomination: slavery. Until, of cource, the protagonist gets sold down the river.
3.  It also has a theme of a society that has found that it can not safely advance its technology anymore. If the technological singularity exists and is to be feared, then this is a theme we need to think on.

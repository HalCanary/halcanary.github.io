Over the past month, this graph has shown completely chaotic behavior.

I interpret it as having major trends, but nothing that is meaningul on the week timescale.

Doesn't the last month look like this chatoic data?

This graph is from the logistic equation:

    
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    $x=0.5;
    foreach $n (0..600){
        $x = $x*(1-$x)*3.8;
        if ( $n % 11 == 0) {
            print "$n $x \n" if ($n>200); }
    }

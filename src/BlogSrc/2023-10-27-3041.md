SUMMARY=I reccomend the Lean4 Natural Number Game.

I was playing around with the Lean4 [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4/). (Via [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/17g3ujl/comment/k6gmp0d/).) I really like this way of doing mathematics.  Maybe in the future, all upper-level math classes will use this software for homework.  And all math papers too ([Professor Tao is working on formalizing his papers in Lean4!](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/111287749336059662))

<p>How to make iced tea.  The one true way.</p>
<p>Any tea that does not use boiling water runs the risk of not killing<br />
the bacteria that might be living in the tea leaves.</p>
<p>prep:<br />
0) Make two trays of ice.</p>
<p>1) Bring about 1.5 quarts of water to a boil.  </p>
<p>2) Get a two-quart pitcher (Thick high-density polyethylene (<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5e/Recycle-resin-logos-lr_02.png/50px-Recycle-resin-logos-lr_02.png" alt="HDPE" />) is<br />
   good.)  Add two large (6g) tea bags.  Add about 5 cups of boiling<br />
   water (This will fill the pitcher about 60% of the way.)  </p>
<p>3) Let steep for exactly 5 minutes.</p>
<p>4) Remove tea bags.  </p>
<p>(Optional) Add sweetening agent now.  This is completely unnecessary.<br />
If you drink unsweetened tea for a while, you will acquire the taste<br />
for it.  The most common sweetening agent is sucrose, which should be<br />
classified as a Schedule II Drug.</p>
<p>5) Fill the pitcher to the 2-quart line by adding<br />
   ice cubes.  This will bring the tea down to room temperature.</p>
<p>6) Put it the the refrigerator to bring it down further.  Or just pour<br />
   over ice to cool it immediately.</p>
<p>Drink within 12 hours, or it tastes bad.</p>

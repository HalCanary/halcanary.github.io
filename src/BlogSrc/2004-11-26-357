<p>One more thing about how the dollar's decline will effect us:  Stephen Roach has a column,<br />
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/26/opinion/26roach.html">When Weakness Is a Strength</a>&rdquo;<br />
in todays <em>Times</em>.  It discusses two possible outcomes: a market crash or a managed correction.</p>

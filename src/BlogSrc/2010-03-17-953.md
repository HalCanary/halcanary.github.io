About ten years ago, I wrote a C++ program to print out all the prime numbers less than a given number using trial division. I recently went back and looked at the program and realized how little I knew at the time. Even though my first CS class covered object-oriented programming in C++, we never really talked the about simply using the `new` keyword on arrays to make use of dynamic arrays. The topic was covered in my second CS class, which I took three years later.

    
    int *array;
    int array_size = 128;
    array = new int[array_size];
    
    /* do somthing to fill the array */
    
    int *temparray = new int[(array_size * 2)];
    for (int i = 0; i < array_size; i++)
        temparray[i] = array[i];
    array_size = array_size * 2;
    delete [] array;
    array = temparray;
    

In the last few years, I have realized that for the simplest progrmas, C is often more efficient and straightforward than C++. In C, the code looks exactly the same, except that `new` is replaced by `malloc()` and `delete` is replaced by `free()`.

    
    int *array;
    int *temparray;
    int array_size = 128;
    int i;
    array = malloc(array_size * sizeof(*array));
    
    /* do somthing to fill the array */
    
    temparray = malloc(array_size * 2 * sizeof(*temparray));
    for (i = 0; i < array_size; i++)
        temparray[i] = array[i];
    array_size = (array_size * 2);
    free(array);
    array = temparray;

Just did a reboot of my FC2 workstation, started a terminal emulator and a browser.

    
    $ head -2 /proc/meminfo
    MemTotal:      1035692 kB
    MemFree:        686080 kB
    $ echo $(( (1035692-686080)/1024 ))
    341
    

Including buffers, the system takes 341 MB of RAM just to get going. And you can still buy desktops with 256 MB!

I must admit that Linux 2.6.x tends to be optimized more for lots of RAM, as compaired to 2.2.x or 2.4.x.

Actually, if I was going to recomend a desktop for those who take no pleasure in building thier own system, I'd say go with something like the HPQ [SR1000Z](http://tinyurl.com/4pczd). Take the slowest Athlon XP offered and 1GB of RAM. I think this is what I reccomended to my father a year ago, and I think he's happy with that computer.

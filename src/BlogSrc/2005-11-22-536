<p>Vacation Day Two.</p>
<p>Went to the <a href="http://www.audubon.org/local/sanctuary/corkscrew/">Corkscrew Swamp Sactuary</a>. The most interesting point in the 2.25 mi hike is when a sign asks you to stop and smell the air. It was possibly the cleanest air you have ever smelled. The sign then quoted a writer from three hundred years ago, who says swamps are places of foul air, disease and decay.</p>
<p>I used to live a few miles from a cypress swamp.  It was a cool place.</p>

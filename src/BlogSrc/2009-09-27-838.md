If you are a LTS user like me and stuck on Hardy Heron, sometimes packages are availible that have the newest shiniest thing prepackaged for you. Emacs 23 can be installed with a simple

    sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot-gtk

and then I wrote a little script to launch emacs with my favorite font:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec emacs-snapshot \
      -fn "Monospace-11" "$@"

Another bleeding-edge thing to check out is Google Chrome's native Linux edition. Go get it [from this page](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Linux).

<blockquote><p>A culture of freedom is one where people see the nature of their work as a reflection of their character&mdash;rather than seeing the market value of their work as a reflection of their worth.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where fraudulently putting one's name on another's work to make one appear a better artist is an utterly petty and ridiculous crime&mdash;as silly as putting one's name on another's photograph to make one's face more attractive.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where artists are paid for making art just as farmers are paid for making food&mdash;and where for an artist to control her art's evolution and growth is as unnatural as a farmer dictating how people may eat the food they buy from her.</p>
<p>A culture of freedom is one where sacrificing wealth and comfort for the sake of knowledge and creativity is as noble as sacrificing wealth and comfort for the sake of family and friends&mdash;and where both choices are increasingly seen as avoidable ones.</p>

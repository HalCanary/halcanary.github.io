<p>Today is St. Patrick's Day. Kyle says that the war would have  started today, but for that fact. Someone in the administration  probably noted that it would be unseemly for Al-Jazeera to broadcast  images of Americans geting roaring drunk on Jameson's, Guinness, and  Harp on the day that we start an invasion. Probably worse than when  some Palestinean punks cheered September 11. </p>
<p>I kinda think Kyle is right. About the timing issue, that is.</p>
<p>I had planned to sponsor a debate on the war next week, assuming it  hasn't started yet. It looks like it won't happen.</p>

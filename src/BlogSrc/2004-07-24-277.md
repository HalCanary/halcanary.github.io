Attention Madisonians!

For some time there has not been anywhere to buy a cup of coffee / breakfast downtown after 2am. This has changed. Now the [Come Back Inn](https://www.google.com/search?q=Come+Back+Inn+Madison+WI) is open 24 hours friday and saturday nights.

That is all.

**UPDATE 2004-07-26**: The omelets aren't great, but they have a lot of veggies in them. And the coffee is bottomless.

[![[]](/images/book-rcw-chronoliths.jpg)](/isbn/?0812545249)I'm awake. The neighbors have stopped playing _OK Computer_ through the wall. And I just finished Robert Charles Wilson's [_Chronoliths_](/isbn/?0812545249).

The Plot is similar to [_Spin_](/isbn/?0765309386). Un-understandable cosmic event effects the life of Johnny Everyman, along with the rest of the planet. Eventually, decades later, we find out what the hell happened. Character developnent ensues.

What intersts me is that _The Chronoliths_ plugs directly into this century's zeitgeist, even though it was published in August 2001.

I am a little worried that the two of RCW's books I've read have similar plots and themes. But then again, most authors do that.

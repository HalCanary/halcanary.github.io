Caribbean Islanders are odd people. They always want to talk religion, even if you met thirty seconds ago.

Last friday: "You look like a priest. Are you a Jew?"

"No"

"You must be a Jew. Are you a Jew?"

I started ignoring him at that point.

And a few months ago, an islander woman started asking me about my religion. When I wouldn't admit to one, she looked at me like I was the most evil person she had met.

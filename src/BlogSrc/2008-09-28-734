<p>Caribbean Islanders are odd people.  They always want to talk religion, even if you met thirty seconds ago.  </p>
<p>Last friday:  "You look like a priest.  Are you a Jew?"</p>
<p>"No"</p>
<p>"You must be a Jew.  Are you a Jew?"</p>
<p>I started ignoring him at that point.</p>
<p>And a few months ago, an islander woman started asking me about my religion.  When I wouldn't admit to one, she looked at me like I was the most evil person she had met.</p>

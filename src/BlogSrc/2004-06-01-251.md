I'm publishing this address, in this form:

mailto: test at halcanary dot org

on this page as a test of spam email harvesters. This seems like the simplest way to spam-armor an email address. So far I've got no spam at that address since I put the address up on May 21.

This is encouraging. I should be able to switch to another address for all of my personal communication and, as long as I don't use it for mailing lists, usenet, or www forums, it should remain hidden from spammers.

**UPDATE 2004-08-11:** Still no spam at that address. Cool!

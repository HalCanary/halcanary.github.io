In high-school chemistry, you learn that the ideal gas law is

<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em>&middot;<em>V</em> =
<em>n</em>&middot;<em>R</em>&middot;<em>T</em></div>

These letters are drilled into my head, but I realised yesterday that
I am losing my intuitive understanding of the relation.  The physics
version of it is

<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em>&middot;<em>V</em> =
<em>N</em>&middot;<em>kT</em></div>

where *N* is now a dimensionless number and *k* is comes from the
definition of *T*.  Let *ρ* be our number density and the relation
simplifies to

<div style="text-align:center;"><em>P</em> =
<em>ρ</em>&middot;<em>kT</em></div>

Pressure is density times temperature.

In the heterogeneous CS Unix environment, I may be executing emacs
from a console as “`emacs -nw`” or from an icon on the desktop.  Some
computers will have the emacs-color-theme package installed, others
won't.  So in my .emacs file, I put the following lines:

    ;; from .emacs ...
    (setq emacs-style-file "~/.emacs-style")
    (when
        (and window-system
             (require 'color-theme nil t)
             (file-readable-p emacs-style-file))
      (progn
        (load emacs-style-file)
    (my-color-theme)))

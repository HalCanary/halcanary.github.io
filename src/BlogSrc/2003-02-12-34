<p>We had a wonderful amount of snowfall the last two days.  Espcially since I have avoided driving in it. I love public transportation. </p>
<p>I've planned a party for all of my friends. I realized  that the different circles don't interact much. Maybe  there will be a violent chemical reaction between them.</p>

Today I wanted to play Civ III on my computer. It required booting into windows. Now don't get me wrong, Windows XP is a fine operating system....for playing games on. I'd hate to have a job where I was required to do any work on such a machine. Or if I had such a job, I'd quit it after 18 months.

Windows has been unable to boot since I put in a new motherboard and processor. So I took this opportunity to reinstall windows and repartition /dev/hda. (You can't fit windows XP on 2GB. Don't even try.) Of course the istallation wrote over my master boot record. I had a little problem restoring it. I'll let you know what I ended up doing in case it ever helps someone else. (Although I think my setup is probably unique.)

1.  put in redhat install disk. Boot into rescue mode. It will mount your filesystmes under `/mnt/sysimage`.
2.  If `/boot` is a seperate partition, unmount it first: "`umount /mnt/sysimage/boot`".
3.  `chroot /mnt/sysimage`
4.  remount the `/boot` partition: "`mount /dev/hdb1 /boot`".
5.  `grub-install '(hd0)'`

<p>Today I wanted to play Civ III on my computer. It required booting into windows. Now don't get me wrong, Windows XP is a fine operating system....for playing games on. I'd hate to have a job where I was required to do any work on such a machine. Or if I had such a job, I'd quit it after 18 months.</p>
<p>Windows has been unable to boot since I put in a new motherboard and processor. So I took this opportunity to reinstall windows and repartition /dev/hda. (You can't fit windows XP on 2GB. Don't even try.) Of course the istallation wrote over my master boot record. I had a little problem restoring it. I'll let you know what I ended up doing in case it ever helps someone else. (Although I think my setup is probably unique.)</p>
<ol>
<li>put in redhat install disk. Boot into rescue mode. It will mount your filesystmes under <code>/mnt/sysimage</code>. </li>
<li>If <code>/boot</code> is a seperate partition, unmount it first:   "<code>umount /mnt/sysimage/boot</code>".</li>
<li><code>chroot /mnt/sysimage</code></li>
<li>remount the <code>/boot</code> partition:  "<code>mount /dev/hdb1 /boot</code>".</li>
<li><code>grub-install '(hd0)'</code></li>
</ol>

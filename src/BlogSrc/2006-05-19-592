<p><abbr title="Google Is Your Friend">GIYF</abbr>. Going <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html">here</a> skips the player detection.  Then one can simply strip the URL from the Page Info dialog, the way God intended.</p>
<p><strong>More background:</strong>  I use Fedora Linux as my main OS on my desktop.  I have several media players installed---Mplayer, Xine, Realplayer, Ogle, Totem.  Some of them will play windows-media-video files without a hitch.  The fools who wrote the cnn website assumed that ONLY Windows Media Player would be able to play such files.  Jackass.</p>

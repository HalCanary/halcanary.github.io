I went to a [talk on qmail last night](http://www.madisonlinux.org/). Here's what I got.

1.  qmail is great, but I don't have any reason to switch from postfix.
2.  [D. J. Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/) is some kind of paranoid mad genius.
3.  Maildir is an elegant solution to the problem of locking mail spools. I'm going to try it out.

I changed my look. Special thanks to Mark Chapman, who cut my hair.

Lots of other new things in my life. New advertising campaign: “Need to bring up your grade? ACT NOW!”

Took two exams yesterday. The analysis exam had no super hard questions, but I probably missed some important details in some of my proofs. I hope for liberal quantities of partial credit.

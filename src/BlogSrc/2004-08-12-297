This image shows a keybord with keys color-coded as to what finger you are supposed to use to hit  each key.  My issue:  my D-finger doesn't want to hit the C-key without moving my whole hand.<br />
Why does the layout of the keys and the geometry of my hand conflict with how they teach you top type?</p>

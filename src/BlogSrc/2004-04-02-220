<p>I've been using Ziegler's <em>Linux Firewalls (2nd Edition)</em> to teach myself <code>iptables</code> syntax.   I'm not sure that it's the best book for getting started building firewalls and routers, bcause it advocates really compliated rulesets.</p>
<p><img src="/images/iptables.png" width="270" height="461" alt="[]" /></p>
<p>There are some basic facts about the way iptables works that aren't explained well.  One of them is the diagram on the left.  Everyone always draws it funny.  The way I draw it, all packes travel downward.</p>
<p>Compare the <a href="http://www.linux-firewall-tools.com/ftp/firewall/optimized.firewall.2">giant scripts in Ziegler</a> to <a href="http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//packet-filtering-HOWTO-5.html">Rusty's Really Quick Guide To Packet Filtering</a></p>
<p>When I was done confguring my router, I had a 61 line iptables script that blocked most ports, did SNAT and DNAT.  I didn't feel the need to, for example, DROP packets on the OUTPUT chain.</p>
<p>Ziegler could use a chapter on troubleshooting with tcpdump and other tools.</p>

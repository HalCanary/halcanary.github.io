_From my personal diary, 2004-09-12 Sunday 23:24:02:_

"What is science?" This question is my answer to the questions posed to me recently and independently by two people. They mention "supernatural" things and dare me to refute them. I will not.

Science is a methodology.

*   Repeatability.
*   Mathematical Modeling.
*   Least Hypothesis.
*   More?

What if there are aspects of nature that are not tractable by the methods of science? Would science be able to say anything at all about them?

What we **do** know is that the vast majority of nature is aproachable with the methods of science. I would have to invoke “least hypothesis” to say that all of nature is like that. Bit of a liar's paradox, there?

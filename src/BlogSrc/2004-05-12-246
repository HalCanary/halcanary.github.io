<p>Here is what a time traveler thinks of us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps I should let you all in on a little secret. No one likes you in the future. This time period is looked at as being full of lazy, self-centered, civically ignorant sheep. Perhaps you should be less concerned about me and more concerned about that.</p>

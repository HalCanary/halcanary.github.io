<p>I see that my computer seems to display U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK &rsquo;) with a glyph identical to U+02bc (MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE &#x02bc;). WordPress and most other software seem to convert U+0027 (APOSTROPHE &#x0027;) to U+2019.  That's odd, because nine out of ten times, it's an apostrophe, not a single quote.</p>
<p>Of course the crotchety of fASCIIst in me says stick to the 0x27.  Straight apostrophes were good enough for every great novel ever make on a typewriter.</p>

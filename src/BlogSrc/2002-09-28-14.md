Okay, here's the new page, at the new site, _halcanary.org_. The page is dynamically created. I wrote a couple of perl scripts that do the job.

There's still a lot that's missing. I've done the work, I just need to put it in place. Here's a list:

*   Prefs & styles
*   The other pages.
*   logins for guests
    *   a way to post to the blog via cgi
    *   allow guests to post to the blog too.
*   view old blog entries

Stay tuned!

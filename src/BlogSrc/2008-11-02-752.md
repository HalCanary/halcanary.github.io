I was reading the other day the submission guidelines for a certain publishing house. They wanted [RTF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) documents. One would think plain text would be just as good, but it's easy enough to write a program that converts a utf8-encoded plain text document to a simple [RTF](http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/RTF-Writer/lib/RTF/Cookbook.pod) document. And the output is about a third of the size of the document that you would get from using oowriter.

    import sys
    fi = sys.stdin
    fo = sys.stdout
    encoding = 'UTF-8'
    fo.write(r'{\rtf1\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0 Times New Roman;}}')
    fo.write(r'\paperh15840\paperw12240\margl1800\margr1800\margt1440\margb1440\fs24')
    fo.write('\n')
    for line in fi:
      uline = unicode(line, encoding)
      for char in uline:
        if (char == "\n"):
          fo.write("\\par\n")
          continue
        if (char == "\t"):
          fo.write("\\tab ")
          continue
        if (char == "\\"):
          fo.write("\\\\")
          continue
        if (char == "{"):
          fo.write("\\{")
          continue
        if (char == "}"):
          fo.write("\\}")
          continue
        ordchar = ord(char)
        if (ordchar >= 128):
          fo.write("\\u%d?" % ordchar)
          continue
        fo.write(char)
    fo.write('}\n\n')
    

For a manuscript, you don't want to do any fancy formating, bold text, fonts, colors, curly quotes, et cetera. This avoids all of that jazz. One might want italic text, but that's not [fASCIIst](http://everything2.com/title/fASCIIst) enough, is it?

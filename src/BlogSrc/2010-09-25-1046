At first I had trouble suspending disbelief on the premise, but the book was so well written that the suspension happened anyway.  How? The author stuck to the premise perfectly, creating a perfectly self&#0045;consistant world.  I was somewhat upset that even though most of the mysteries of the book were resolved in the final act, the wierd history was never really explained.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

Scott Fitzgerald (<a href="http://halcanary.org/isbn/?0743273567/The+Great+Gatsby">0743273567</a>), and read by Alexander Scourby (<a href="http://halcanary.org/isbn/?1602834725/The+Great+Gatsby+Audio">1602834725</a>).  I&#0039;m glad I finally got around to this one; I keep telling myself that I&#0039;ll read all the classics of American literature, but I never did, until I got started on the idea of listening to audiobooks while bicycling.<br style="clear:both;" /></p>

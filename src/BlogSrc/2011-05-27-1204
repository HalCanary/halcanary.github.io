<blockquote><p>For a case where sunk costs exist, imagine that you are a new person who was just now teleported into this person's life.  Variant:  Imagine you were just teleported into this person's life, and <em>everyone else knows this</em>, and they all <em>expect</em> you to execute sudden changes of course.  See what this <em>changes about your thinking</em>, regardless of whether it changes your decision.

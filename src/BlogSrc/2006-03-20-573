<p>The car is in the shop.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it.  I'm still waiting for a diagnosment.  I needed to visit the bank today, so I hopped onto the bus and came downtown.  Now I'm hiding out in a coffee shop, killing the time.</p>

<p>I don't need much from a laptop.  A wireless card and a working battery.  I am content with my ancient Compaq, even if it is the uncoolest laptop in the room.</p>
<p>Some years ago I read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warchalking">warchalking</a>.  That fad never became entrenched, and never made it to Madison.  If nothing else, the <strong>)(</strong> open hotspot symbol should be used.</p>

<p>I've got a window seat in this coffee shop.  It affords me great opportunity for people-watching.  Most people are not worth looking at.</p>

<p>Mmmmm.  Coffee.</p>

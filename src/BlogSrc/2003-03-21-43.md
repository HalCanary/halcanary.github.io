[Let's see what the Iraqis have to say about all this.](http://uruklink.net)

Interesting conversation:  
_Me:_ So I sat around all day and watched TV...  
_Her:_ Cartoons?  
_Me:_ No, the news. I've been watching the war all day, and I ought to stop watching so much if it.  
  
_Her:_ You should watch cartoons instead.

The world would be a much better place if we all watched more cartoons.

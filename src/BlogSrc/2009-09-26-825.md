What to do with this info? first of all, print out the fingerprints and put them in your wallet.

Here's another thing I do:

    ssh-show-key-fingerprint | \
      sudo tee -a /etc/issue.ssh > /dev/null
    echo 'Banner /etc/issue.ssh' | \
      sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config > /dev/null

This, of course, is in no way a secure way to check your fingerprint, since it is just as vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. But it works as a backup plan.

And some legal theories say you should insert these additional lines into your /ets/issue.ssh file:

     UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS PROHIBITED.

     CONSTITUTES CONSENT TO THIS MONITORING, INTERCEPTION,

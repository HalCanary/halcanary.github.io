      a common idiom:
     */
    void C::f() {
      if (this->ptr != NULL) {
        delete this->ptr;
        this->ptr = NULL;
      }
    }
    /*
      proposed new syntax: a delete expression evaluates to reference to
      the pointer that was deleted, to make it easer to remember to set
      that pointer to NULL.
     */
    void C::f() {
      if (this->ptr != NULL)
        (delete this->ptr) = NULL;
    }

**UPDATE** 2013-05-12: Stroustrup suggests an alternative:

    template<class T>
    inline void destroy(T*& p) {
      delete p;
      p = NULL;
    }

<p>Funny story. This year, my dad got a new desktop from HPQ. It had an AMD Athlon processor, but on the outside it had one of theose &quot;Intel Inside&quot; decals. I'm not sure which of the two companies should be more upset at HPQ's gaff: AMD for not getting the credit they deserve or Intel for having thier brand name diluted.</p>

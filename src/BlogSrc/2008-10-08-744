<p>(4) The Historocrats. Your basic time travel story.  Five hundred years in the future, a group of people decide that human civilization messed up too badly and goes back in time to start over.  They are accompanied by a group of historians who just want to find out how people lived before the invention of writing.  So a large group travels back to 4001 BCE (6000 HE) and set up small nation on an island somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

“His suggestions for securing the U.S.-Mexico border went beyond walls to include moats, fiery moats and fiery moats with fire-proof crocodiles.” ([source](http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002613019))

Fire-proof crocodiles are expensive. Wouldn't ut be easier to have TWO parallel moats, one filled with crocodiles, and another one filled with fire?

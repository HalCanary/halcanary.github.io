<p>Spent the past week or two cleaning my room.  The most recent spirt of activity was caused by a search for a CD-ROM I last saw floating around six months ago.  It may be lost forever, becasue I never found it.  I ended up carting a large box off to goodwill and filling four big trash bags.</p>
<p>Then last night I went through the clothes hanging on my closet.  I removed over half of them becasue they were too big;  I folded them up and boxed them.  Even though they represent almost eighty pounds lost in the past two-and-a-half years, it's still a lot of money spent on clothes wasted.  I think from now on I'm going to try to make do with a lot less clothing and try to purge the closet more often.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with ssh is the vulnerability to a man-in-the-middle attack. This is why you should always check your host-key's fingerprint when logging on for the first time from a new box. To aquire these keys, do this:</p>
<pre>
for x in /etc/ssh/*pub; do
   ssh-keygen -lf $x;
done
</pre>

One-time pads are an old-fashoned way of doing cryptography, not used much these days. On the other hand, they are as secure as the random device is random. (Want a better random device? [here's one](http://www.protego.se/sg100_en.htm).)

I've been meaning to write this code for a while now:

    
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    ## crypt-otp.pl ##
    if (@ARGV OUTPUT\n";
        exit 1;
    }
    my $a_file = shift @ARGV;
    my $b_file = shift @ARGV;
    open(OTP, "< $a_file");
    open(PTX, "< $b_file");
    while (read(PTX,$b,1)) {
        read(OTP,$a,1) or die "Out of otp.";
        print $a ^ $b;
    }
    

Here's how to use it.

    
    $ head -c 10k /dev/random > otp.data
    $ ./crypt-otp.pl otp.data file > file.crypt
    $ ./crypt-otp.pl otp.data file.crypt | less
    

Here's how NOT to use it:

    
    $ perl -e 'for $x (1..1000) {print "PASSWORD"}' > badotp
    $ gzip < file | ./crypt-otp.pl  badotp - > x
    $ ./crypt-otp.pl badotp x | gunzip - | less
    

If /dev/random hangs, jiggle your mouse for a while to build up entropy. If you input file is biger than your OTP, then it won't work. That's the one part of one-time. So make a bigger OTP by changing the argument to head.

<p>With the newer releases of linux distributions, things have become extraordinarily user-friendly.  This is the only bug I've discovered so far  <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=141043"> and it's a minor problem with an easy work-around.</a></p>
<p>Of course, to do things RIGHT, you do need to know what you are doing. I still want to be able to partition my own drives, write my own firewall scripts,  and change a lot of the other configurations; and I can still do all of those things.</p>

<p>===THE YEAR IN RENTAL DVDs 2007===</p>
<p>Hot Fuzz - loved it.  May have to buy it at some point.</p>
<p>Stranger than Fiction - was okay.  Don't need to see it again.</p>
<p>Reign Over Me - liked it.  Kind of depressing, but good.</p>
<p>Black Snake Moan - still can't decide on this one.  It may be a horrible movie, but I watched the whole thing.</p>
<p>300 - eh.  Too full of itself.</p>

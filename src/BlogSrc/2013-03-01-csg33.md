```C++
/*
  a common idiom:
 */
void C::f() {
  if (this->ptr != NULL) {
    delete this->ptr;
    this->ptr = NULL;
  }
}
/*
  proposed new syntax: a delete expression evaluates to reference to
  the pointer that was deleted, to make it easer to remember to set
  that pointer to NULL.
 */
void C::f() {
  if (this->ptr != NULL)
    (delete this->ptr) = NULL;
}
```

**UPDATE** 2013-05-12: Stroustrup suggests an alternative:

```C++
template<class T>
inline void destroy(T*& p) {
  delete p;
  p = NULL;
}
```

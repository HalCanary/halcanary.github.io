TITLE=Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing

Odd issue in linux/x11. I used to have the evil proprietary Nvidia drivers loaded. I gave up on them recently, but once I installed a new kernel without them, glx (openGL for x) stopped working. I got the error:

`Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0"`

It should have worked, as the file `/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.a` should have provided this funtionality.

But alas, Xorg X11 was using the file `/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions/libglx.so.1.0.5336`, left over from the proprietary driver. I deleted this file, restarted X11, and it all workes correctly! I have a fast enough processor that most small openGL apps work fine without hardware acceleration.

<blockquote><p>Steve Schmidt, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, accused Kerry of a &ldquo;consistent pattern of inserting politics and playing politics with the war on terror and serious national security issues.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the hell is he saying?  Is he implying that all politicans should avoid "serious national security issues"  Does this include the president himself?  is GWB above politics?  When he's fundraising or giving stump speeches, does GWB avoid these issues?</p>
<p>I really don't know what to make of this.</p>
<p>You can argue with his position, but how can you argue with the fact that he <strong>has</strong> as position?</p>

<p>Dean has promised that he'll drop out if he loses Wisconsin.  </p>
<p>Conversely, he has indicated that he'll stay in <strong>until</strong> Wisconsin.</p>
<p>That mean that there will be at least two candidates left on the ballot by the time I get to vote.  I'm releaved.  At the rate they were dropping out, I figured that there'll be no choice left by the 17th.</p>

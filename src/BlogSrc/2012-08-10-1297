<p> Each member of a legislature has a set of public git repositories; each repository is a proposed law.  A legislator can "vote" for any commit in one of his or someone else's repos by digitally signing the commit's hash.  As soon as a particular version of a law (in the form of a particular commit) has 50%+1 of the legislator's signatures, it is passed.</p>
<p>Why do I want this?  git blame.</p>

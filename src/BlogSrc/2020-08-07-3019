SUMMARY=Remembering my uncle.

My father's sister's husband, my Uncle Ranny, passed away earlier this year. Even though I never spent much time with him, when I did get to visit him, he was always kind and nice to talk to.

When Ranny Church told me that his uncle was Alonzo Church of the Church-Turing thesis and the lambda calculus, I though he was joking about the fact that I was studying computer science and that he happened to share a last name with one of the fathers of theoretical computer science.  But in fact, he wasn't joking.  My uncle's uncle was _the_ [Alonzo Church (1903-1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church), son of Samuel Robbins Church and Mildred Hannah Parker Church, Ranny's grandparents.

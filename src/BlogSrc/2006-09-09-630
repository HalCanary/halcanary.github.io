<blockquote><p><strong>Dean:</strong> THEY'RE HERE!!</p>
<p><strong>Hank:</strong> Dude, sit down! We have to play it cool. Observe how I scope out my mystery date whilst I pretend to look at my watch- Holy moley, look at my date! She's a super villain! Possibly a medusa. Dean, I am not kidding. She has rope for hair and a shiny costume! Aw, not fair, she's wearing goggles! Told ya she would dig my Batman suit, but no!</p>

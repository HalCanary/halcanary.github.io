I played around with Movable Type this weekend. I liked it, but have a couple of issues. I think it should come with a couple of dozen stylesheets for users to choose from. I spent an hour playing with CSS before I got [something I liked](https://halcanary.org/vv/).

The one thing I don't like is that it groups entries by date. That seems very unnatural.

The number of Iraqi civilians killed in the war is somewhere between [15,289](http://www.iraqbodycount.net/) and [100,000](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4076993.stm). Good to see that we have a number that's at most off by one order of magnitude.

Apoligists for the war would say that the true number is somewhere on the low end. I'd like to see GWB in front of a war crimes tribunal:

"But, your honor, we only killed _fifteen thousand_ inocent civilians, not that other number!"

<p>I've got an exam in a few hours, then I'm out of school for a while. The next major project is GRE studying. I've also got a stack of books to read for fun. And <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) comes out tomorrow, so I'll be reinstalling for the first time since I built this computer.</p>

Good Morning. This is my blog. The idea here is that I'll post here on a regular basis, and other people are encouraged to do so too.

Here are my plans for this blog:

1.  A login system to track users.
2.  Skinnable Style Sheets.
3.  Integration with the [chatting applet](/~hal/ApChat/)
4.  Perhapse eventually make my whole site dynamically generated.

Now a link. This is [my new desktop background](http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/2002/05/pr-photos.html) on my work computer.

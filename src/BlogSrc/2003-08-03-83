I've decided to do a few upgrades on my two year old computer. For some reason my old mobo would balk if I put in more than 256MB of RAM.

So I began by buying a new motherboard+processor+RAM: an Athlon XP 2200+ and a ASUS A7N8X. I'll stick that in my old case and keep my old drives in that case. I'll probably end up giving it a new name. Possibly _lensman_.

Then I'll put my old mobo+processor (still called _dalek_) in a new case in my living room. Just to keep things simple I'll run Knoppix on that machine so that I don't have to worry about hard drives. Then I can play music off of a nfs mounted drive from lensman.

<p>I've decided to do a few upgrades on my two year old computer. For  some reason my old mobo would balk if I put in more than 256MB of RAM. </p>
<p>So I began by buying a new motherboard+processor+RAM: an Athlon XP 2200+ and a ASUS A7N8X. I'll stick that in my old case and keep my old drives in that case.  I'll probably end up giving it a new name. Possibly <em>lensman</em>.</p>
<p>Then I'll put my old mobo+processor (still called <em>dalek</em>) in a new case in my living room. Just to keep things simple I'll run Knoppix on that machine so that I don't have to worry about hard drives. Then I can play music off of a nfs mounted drive from lensman.</p>

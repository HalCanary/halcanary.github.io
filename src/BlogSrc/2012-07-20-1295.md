Re [Six Policies Economists Love And Politicians Hate](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate):

I've been saying things like this for some time. My only caveat is that it is important to keep both the income tax and the earned income tax credit to keep the system progressive. If the consumption tax is high enough, we could limit the income/payroll tax to income above what the median earner makes.

<p>I played around with Movable Type this weekend. I liked it, but have a couple of issues. I think it should come with a couple of dozen stylesheets for users to choose from. I spent an hour playing with  CSS before I got  <a href="/vv/">something I liked</a>.</p>
<p>The one thing I don't like is that it groups entries by date. That seems very unnatural.</p>

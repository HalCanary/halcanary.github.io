<blockquote><div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea">Pangaea</a> was not the first supercontinent. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia">Pannotia</a>, that formed about 600&nbsp;mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodinia">Rodinia</a>, apparently formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750&nbsp;mya.<br />(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea">source</a>)</div>

<p>Yesterday I played paintball for the first time ever.  I realized I know nothing about infantry tactics.</p>
<p>Last night I delivered pizza while dressed uo (black shirt, black tie, black pants, black boots, and black polyvinylchloride jacket).  I got the impression that I got better tips. But in the end I didn't have that much more money than normal.</p>
<p>I didn't drink last night, but by the end of the night, I felt drunk.  Either Apollo spiked my diet coke or many of the effects I associate with alcohol are really just manifistations of being up at three in the moring.</p>

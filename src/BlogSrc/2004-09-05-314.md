In the last couple of weeks, I've seen quite a few guys wearing ties at the club. I'm taking as much responsibility for this as possible: I started doing that regularly last fall.

There were also large numbers of guys in drag last night. I had nothing to do with that.

I also saw someone in a business suit. I hate those ugly things. Two words: padded shoulders. Ick.

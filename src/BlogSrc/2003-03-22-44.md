To users of the phoenix browser: I found this page on [Phoenix Help](http://texturizer.net/phoenix/).

If you use phoenix under linux, and you don't have anti-aliased fonts turned on, try [this](http://phoenix.ragweed.net/download/). I just installed it. It rocks.

No war coverage today. They had bloody golf on the tube. Golf! In this time of crisis.

I hiked around the arboretum for a while today. It was nice to be outside.

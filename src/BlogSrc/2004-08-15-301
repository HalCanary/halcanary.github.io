<p>Just did a reboot of my FC2 workstation, started a terminal emulator and a browser.</p>

$ head -2 /proc/meminfo

<p>Including buffers, the system takes 341 MB of RAM just to get going.  And you can still buy desktops with 256 MB!</p>
<p>I must admit that Linux 2.6.x tends to be optimized more for lots of RAM, as compaired to 2.2.x or 2.4.x.</p>
<p>Actually, if I was going to recomend a desktop for those who take no pleasure in building thier own system, I'd say go with something like  the HPQ <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4pczd">SR1000Z</a>. Take the slowest Athlon XP offered and 1GB of RAM.  I think this is what I reccomended to my father a year ago, and I think he's happy with that computer.</p>

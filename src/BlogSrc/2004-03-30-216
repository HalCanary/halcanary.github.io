The past few weeks I've been going to [Bluefin](http://www.bluefinclub.com/) Monday nights. Here's why it's cool:

1.  Open pool table.
2.  Decent DJs. The layout of the club allows one to stand around watching the DJs spin. This is educational.
3.  TVs. I get a chance to catch the _Daily Show_, which I normally miss due to lack of cable.
4.  A playstation at the bar.
5.  Cheap drinks.
6.  No cover.

The car is in the shop. I'm not sure what's wrong with it. I'm still waiting for a diagnosment. I needed to visit the bank today, so I hopped onto the bus and came downtown. Now I'm hiding out in a coffee shop, killing the time.

I don't need much from a laptop. A wireless card and a working battery. I am content with my ancient Compaq, even if it is the uncoolest laptop in the room.

Some years ago I read about [warchalking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warchalking). That fad never became entrenched, and never made it to Madison. If nothing else, the **)(** open hotspot symbol should be used.

I've got a window seat in this coffee shop. It affords me great opportunity for people-watching. Most people are not worth looking at.

Mmmmm. Coffee.

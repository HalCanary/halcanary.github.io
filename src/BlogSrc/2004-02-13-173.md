I got into an argument with the physics geeks (term used affectionately; I used to be a physics geek) today. I objected to the assumtion that the term “Christian” implied a belief in the literal interpretation of the book of Revelation, among other things.

Kids today are absolutists. Being a Christian means this. Being an Anarchist means that. This band is cool. That band sucks.

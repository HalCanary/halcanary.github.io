<p>For my birthday, the folks gave me a <a href="http://www.etoncorp.co.uk/fr250.html">radio with built-in dynamo</a>.  I've wanted one of these for years.  90 seconds of cranking is supposed to provide an hour of music.  </p>
<p>One can also charge a cellphone with the dynamo.  But not <em>my</em> cell phone, because every cell phone uses a unique connector.</p>

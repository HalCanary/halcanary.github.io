<p>When I made the second, I did it on thick watercolor paper instead of thin drawing paper.  The inking went a lot  faster because I used a better pen.  I also made a point to draw fewer  lines, under the assumption that I could do more shading with the wash.  I also used a different brush for the second one.  That was a mistake,  I should have used my better brush.</p>

<p>I wandered around state street for a couple of hours last night.  It was pleasant.  I don't do that often enough.  </p>
<p>I recieved a free subscription to <a href="http://www.granta.com/about/">Granta Magazine</a> with my <a href="http://salon.com/">Salon</a> subscription.  I read a few more stories from that when I was hanging around downtown.  They were good.</p>

<p>I had my first practicum this week.  Friday my cooperating teacher had me get up before the class and explain something.  Even though I knew the material cold, and even though I explained it well, I was still nervous.  I am not used to talking to such a large audience, and I could not tell how well the students understood.  I need more experience at this.</p>

As a html author, should I use

<a name="bleg">Text</a>

or

<a name="bleg"></a>Text?

It only matters if one has defined something in css for "a:hover". [The W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#x33) doesn't specify that :hover should apply to any specific element. So one could define css:

span.highlight:hover {
  background-color:#ffffaa;
  color:#000000; }

and use html:

words, <span class="highlight">
 words,</span> words!

All this implies that I should make a point to immediately close "<a name=..." tags, unless I want highlighting.

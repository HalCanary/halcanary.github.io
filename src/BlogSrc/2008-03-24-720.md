Saw today that _Battlestar Galactica_ “Razor” was nominated for the 2008 Hugo for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form. I wouldn't call a 104 minute film "short," even if the abridged version premired on TV before it was released on DVD. I also noticed that I still hadn't watched it, even though the Netflix DVD was sitting on my desk.

So I watched it. Four nested flashbacks. Yeah, I'd vote for it, were I a voter. Although I did like “Blink.”

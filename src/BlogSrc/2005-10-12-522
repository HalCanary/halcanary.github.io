<p><img src="/images/book-building-moon.jpg" width="130" height="211" alt="[cover]" class="fl" />I picked up Larry Niven and Brenda Cooper's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765312662/ref%3Dnosim/theworldofhalcan/"><em>Building Harlequin's Moon</em></a>.  I'm only a third of the way through it.</p>
<p>Impressions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It reminds me a bit of the brainstorming I was doing the other week, without the aliens.</li>
<li>It sets up a situation where you can <em>almost</em> understand why people create an abomination: slavery.  Until, of cource, the protagonist gets sold down the river.</li>
<li>It also has a theme of a society that has found that it can not safely advance its technology anymore.  If the technological singularity exists and is to be feared, then this is a theme we need to think on.</li>
</ol>

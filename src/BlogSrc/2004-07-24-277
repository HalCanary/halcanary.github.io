<p>Attention Madisonians! </p>
<p>For some time there has not been anywhere to buy a cup of coffee / breakfast downtown after 2am.  This has changed.  Now the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Come+Back+Inn+Madison+WI"><br />
Come Back Inn</a> is open 24 hours friday and saturday nights.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-07-26</strong>: The omelets aren't great, but they have a lot of veggies in them.  And the coffee is bottomless.</p>

<p>I bought a new used bike last month. It's nice, but it's a bit too hot during the month of August to want to ride it long distances. I plan on making it my primary mode of transportation as soon as September brings cooler weather.</p>
<p>I picked up a headlamp for my bike today. My old lamp, which I lost, was 15 years old, used C batteries (who has those?), and tended to slide off the handle. The new one uses AA's, and can be unclipped from the (very secure) mounting to serve as a flashlight.</p>

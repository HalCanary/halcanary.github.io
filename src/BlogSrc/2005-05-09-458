<p>I stopped reading my mail a while back. If something is important, like a letter from family or a bill that MUST be paid, I might dig through the pile of spam for it. But most bills go a few months without payment. I have unopened bank statements from last year.</p>
<p>I used to be so responsible. Eight years ago I BALANCED MY CHECKBOOK.</p>
<p>Poll: Should I start being responsible with money again?</p>

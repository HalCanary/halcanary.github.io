<p>Convoluted Story:</p>
<p>I had an hour or so to kill on the westside between shifts this week, so I stopped in the big bookstore they have.  Glancing through the new fiction paperbacks, I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060987103/ref=nosim/theworldofhalcan"><em>Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em></a>.  Someone had recommended it some time ago, saying "it's more political than I would have expected."  I forget who.</p>
<p>So I picked it up, read the first two chapters, and fell asleep in the comfy chairs they have.  After they called me back into work, I bought the book.</p>
<p>I don't know why I liked the book, but here's a guess: the protagonist is flawed in ways that I can identify with.</p>
<p>I wanted to read up on the source material, which has fallen into the public domain.  So I downloaded the text from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a>. </p>
<p>The best way I have to read ebooks is on my palm m105.  I can do this flat on my back, which is how I like to read anyways.  I'd get a fancier PDA, but I can't justify spending money if all I do is read books on the damn thing.</p>
<p>The m105 has some advantages and disadvantages.  It was relatively cheap at the time it was released, and made a nice graduation present from my parents.  It uses 2xAAA batteries, so I don't have to worry about the lifetime of a rechargeable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it uses old-fashioned RAM for its memory and when the batteries die, the memory is all lost.  So every time that happens, I have to reinstall databases and applications.  I've tried to make that as easy as possible:  The directories $HOME/Palm/Docs and $HOME/Palm/Apps contain PalmDoc ebooks and Palm applications.  The pilot-link tools make re-installing everything easy. <code>PILOTPORT=/dev/ttyS0 PILOTRATE=115200 pilot-xfer -i ~/Palm/Docs/* ~/Palm/Apps/*</code></p>
<p>I do wish I had one of the models that relied on a removable Flash drive and not RAM.</p>

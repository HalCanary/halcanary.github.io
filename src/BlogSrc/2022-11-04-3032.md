>   Sergeant Theodora Fusilier, serial number 110552, is one of a hundred
>   thousand machines that share her name, line soldiers in the army of the
>   United Kingdom of Great Britain and Beyond. She was designed to carry a
>   laser musket, protect human space from alien threats, follow the orders of
>   her human officers, and be happy to do so.

>   But Dora's always been a rather ambitious machineâ€¦
>
>   Set in the same universe as _Maid to Love You_. Expect worldbuilding that
>   doesn't try to make sense, laser muskets, adorable robots, and possibly
>   some lewd bits.

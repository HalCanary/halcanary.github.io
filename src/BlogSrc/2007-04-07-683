<blockquote><p>
Jesus knew viral marketing.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of Mark, the disciple John complains that nondisciples are selling bootlegged copies of Jesus&rsquo; miraculous powers. &ldquo;Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus tells John to quit obsessing about the intellectual property and to focus on getting the brand out. &ldquo;Do not stop him; for no one who does a deed of power in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.&rdquo; Jesus adds, &ldquo;Whoever is not against us is for us.&rdquo; </p>

The _London Times_ will no longer print a broadsheet edition; instead they will print only an easy to read tabloid edition. ([source](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1336148,00.html))

I've always hated the size of boradsheets. They are too big to fold easily. So why are they that size? “Historically, broadsheets were developed when in 1712 a tax was placed on British newspapers based on the number of their pages.” ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet))

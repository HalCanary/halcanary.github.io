<p>The folks just sent me their old P200 laptop.  (It barely qualifies as a notebook, as its dimentions are 8.5 x 11 x 2.2 inches.) Thanks, guys.</p>
<p>It's a Compaq Armada 1571DM.  I named him <em>nimrod</em>.</p>
<p>He's a behemoth.  CD <strong>and</strong> floppy drive.  Integrated power supply. 12-inch 800x600 screen.  With all that, there is just one usb port and no ethernet jack.  And you can tell the previous owner (Dad) showed him some love: good condition, maxed out RAM (96 Megs), LCD in great shape.</p>
<p>I shredded the drive and installed linux.</p>
<p>Due to the ancientness of the hardware, this became an excersize in minimalism.  Windowmaker is still good, if not user-friendly, so I didn't even bother trying something newer.  Back in the day, I would use netscape 4.x, but I'm going to give dillo a try this time around.  I considered forgoing the gui alltogether, but knew I would want it for browsing, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Turns out that yum uses a lot of processor power when it resolves dependencies.  Or maybe it gets into infinite loops.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-09-12:</strong>The battery is quite dead, and I'll never get the winmodem to work. I may have to invest in a pcmcia modem at some point.  But everything else seems to work perfectly.</p>

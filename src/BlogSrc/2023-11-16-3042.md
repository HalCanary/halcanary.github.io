SUMMARY=Just a list of brightest objects in the sky.

Sometimes, when I want to quickly identify the planets I see in the early evening and before dawn, the planetarium/sky map app on my phone is sometimes harder to use than I want.

I would love to have an website that uses your location and the time to list the brightest dozen objects in the sky right now, along with current azimuth and altitude.

Living in the city, I can barely see few dozen stars anyway.

<li>   <a href="http://salon.com/audio/music/2003/01/07/godspeed/">   Godspeed   You! Black Emperor</a> - I saw this salon article and mp3. I   downloaded the song, and it's growing on me. Dl'ed more on    Kazaalight   and like the moodyness. Am I turning into pretentious bastard?   Would anyone notice the difference?  </li>
<li>   For those interested in web design, here is   <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>. Interesting   articles, although most are old. Ignore if you have a life.  </li>

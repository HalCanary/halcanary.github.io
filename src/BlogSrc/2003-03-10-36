*   [Godspeed You! Black Emperor](http://salon.com/audio/music/2003/01/07/godspeed/) - I saw this salon article and mp3. I downloaded the song, and it's growing on me. Dl'ed more on Kazaalight and like the moodyness. Am I turning into pretentious bastard? Would anyone notice the difference?
*   For those interested in web design, here is [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/). Interesting articles, although most are old. Ignore if you have a life.

It amazes me how little work I get done on the weekend. Look, it's almost over and I accomplished squat.

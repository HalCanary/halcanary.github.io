<p>I've been using Fedora Linux on six computers I'm responsible for.  I like it a lot.  Here's why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The project is becoming more open.  All of the how-to-hack-the-system info that RedHat never published is being provided bu the community now.</li>
<li>More and more third-party rpms are being made availible.  Quality is improving.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a FC1 system, you really should go to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">fedora.redhat.com.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fedora.artoo.net/faq/">The Unofficial Fedora FAQ</a>: info on setting up yum repositorys (hint: use the mirror.kernel.org mirror), info on installing java jdk or sdk correctly. Maintained by Max Kanat-Alexander.</li>
<li><a href="http://fedoranews.org/">FedoraNews</a>: news from the fedora-list mailing list, beginner hints, building RPM packages for your system. Maintained by Thomas Chung.</li>
</ul>

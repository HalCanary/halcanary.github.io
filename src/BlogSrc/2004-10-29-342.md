I used to be able to go to the WPR website to find out what's playing now. Not anymore:

> Effective February 26, 2004, our music listings are only be available starting the day after broadcast. Information will continue to be available at all times from WPR Listener Services at 1-800-747-7444. We apologize for what we hope will be a temporary inconvenience.
> 
> Unfortunately, a recent ruling on the scope of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act passed by Congress prohibits us from making advance play lists available to the public as long as we stream our broadcast service on the Internet. WPR is working with CPB, NPR and similarly affected public radio stations around the country to secure permission from the music industry to reinstate this service. Again, our sincere apologies.

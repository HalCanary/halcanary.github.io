<p><em>An open letter to the cute red-headed girl whom I often see in the elevator and to whom I've never spoken and who was either giving me the evil eye or checking me out yesterday.</em></p>
<p>March 8, 2005</p>
<p>Dear cute red-headed girl whom I often see in the elevator and to whom I've never spoken and who was either giving me the evil eye or checking me out yesterday,</p>
<p>So... Nice weather? </p>
<p>Sincerly,</p>
<p>Hal W. Canary</p>

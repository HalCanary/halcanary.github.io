> Some segments of the Linux user community, which prefer to avoid the IP-encumbered ATI drivers due to ideological choices, still prefer the R200-based chips, as they are among the fastest modern video cards with stable open source drivers. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_R200))

My ATI RV280 Radeon 9200 works great with The new Compiz window manager that comes with Fedora Core 6. Using the `desktop-effects` program, you can replace the old window manager (Metacity) with Compiz. Compiz makes use of neat effects such as the spinning cube and the scaler plugin (similar to OSX's expos√©).

For once, something just works.

      /apps/compiz/plugins/cube/screen0/options/in \
      --set true

Compiz has more options. It's a bit of a kludge ot change them.

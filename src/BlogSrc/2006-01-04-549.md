Things will get seriously fracked up when two differnet operating systems try and access the same HDD partition at the same time.

How can this happen?  
  
I found out.

1) Run some programs in windows xp.

2) Tell XP to hibernate

3) Boot into linux

4) access FAT filesystem, say to copy some music over to the d:\\music directory.

5) reboot to windows.

6) Wait til it hits the fan.

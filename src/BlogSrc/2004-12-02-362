<p>I saw Zhang Yimou's <em>House of Flying Daggers</em> on Saturday.  If you liked <em>Hero</em>, then you will probably like this one a little better.  Ther story is a bit more tight.  If you hated <em>Hero</em>, then I don't know what you would think of this one.</p>
<p>Again, it  has beautiful cinimatography.  Again, the plot has twists and turns. I liked Ziyi Zhang's performace in this one a lot.</p>

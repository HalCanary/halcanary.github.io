<p><strong>Warning/Disclaimer.</strong></p>
<p>Te following is a geeky linux-related post.  Chances are, you will want to skip it.  If you are a cute yet non-geeky cyber-stalker, please skip to the next post, which will be about politics, grammar, or food.</p>
<p>I see that Fedora Extras (The add-ons meant to supplement Fedora Core) have finally been moved to the download.fedora.redhat.com server.  I also notice that new packages have been added, such as the ever-popular packages<br />
gqview, perl-GD, sodipodi, gnofract4d, and starfighter</p>

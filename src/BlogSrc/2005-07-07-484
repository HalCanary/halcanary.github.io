<p>People like me read the encylopedia for fun.</p>
<p>Today I read about Li-ion batteries.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_ion_battery">&ldquo; At a typical 100% charge level at 25 degrees Celsius, Li-ion batteries irreversibly lose approximately 20% capacity per year from the time they are manufactured, even when unused.&rdquo;</a></p>

When I made the second, I did it on thick watercolor paper instead of thin drawing paper. The inking went a lot faster because I used a better pen. I also made a point to draw fewer lines, under the assumption that I could do more shading with the wash. I also used a different brush for the second one. That was a mistake, I should have used my better brush.

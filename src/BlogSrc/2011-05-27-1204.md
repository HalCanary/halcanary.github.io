> For a case where sunk costs exist, imagine that you are a new person who was just now teleported into this person's life. Variant: Imagine you were just teleported into this person's life, and _everyone else knows this_, and they all _expect_ you to execute sudden changes of course. See what this _changes about your thinking_, regardless of whether it changes your decision. ([source](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/49d7))

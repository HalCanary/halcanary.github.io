<p>Some cool things in my life:</p>
<ol>
<li>I heard Stephen Wolfram talk. That was much cheaper than buying his book. And I don't need another thick book to work on at the moment. I'm currently trying to get through Dostoevsky's <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>. It has taken me a year to get through 15% of the book.</li>
<li>Last sunday I heard a live harpsichord performance of the first prelude &amp; fugue from <em>The Well-Tempered Klavier</em>. That was unexpected.</li>
<li>I finally got the broken seat in my car fixed. I am no longer driving a wreck-waiting-to-happen.</li>

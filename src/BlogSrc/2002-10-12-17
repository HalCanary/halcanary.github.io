Some cool things in my life:

1.  I heard Stephen Wolfram talk. That was much cheaper than buying his book. And I don't need another thick book to work on at the moment. I'm currently trying to get through Dostoevsky's _The Brothers Karamazov_. It has taken me a year to get through 15% of the book.
2.  Last sunday I heard a live harpsichord performance of the first prelude & fugue from _The Well-Tempered Klavier_. That was unexpected.
3.  I finally got the broken seat in my car fixed. I am no longer driving a wreck-waiting-to-happen.

Cool Factoid of the week: [Owen Taylor says, _“Support for changing resolutions on the fly was just added to XFree86 CVS a couple of days ago.”_](http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1901&page=3)

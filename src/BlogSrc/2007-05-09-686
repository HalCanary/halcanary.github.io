Depending on the wind direction, it can be overcast with smoke for miles and miles without end.</p>
<p>Parts of I-75 have been closed.</p>
<p>It seems to be worse in the afternoons.  I can see blue skies this morning and last night the air didn't smell too much like burning grass as I drove home.</p>

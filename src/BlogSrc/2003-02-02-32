[It looks like someone was able to install linux on thier Vaio SRX87.](http://www.differentpla.net/~roger/hardware/vaio/linux/) Now I don't know if I need to go to the effort of duplicating that effort, considering that I am relativly happy with things the way things are. I'll probably give it a try sometime in the future.

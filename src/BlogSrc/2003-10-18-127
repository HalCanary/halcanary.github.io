Here's a recipe:

1.  Get two slices of bread. (I like whole wheat)
2.  Let some butter sit out for a few minutes, until it gets mushy. Noone likes firm butter.
3.  Slice some cheese into thin slices. I like medium chedder or colby.
4.  Get some thin slices of smaked turkey or other meat. I simply used lunch meat from the deli.
5.  Put it all together: bread, layer of cheese, layer of meat, layer of cheese, and bread.
6.  Then spread a large amount of butter evenly on the outside of the bread.
7.  Put a pan on the stove. Heat to medium-hot.
8.  Grill until the bttom layer of cheese looks kinda soft. Flip and repeat. Then flip once more for the fianl bit of toasting. Bread should be a beautiful golden color.
9.  Cut in half.
10.  Eat.

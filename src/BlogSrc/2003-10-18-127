<p>Here's a recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get two slices of bread. (I like whole wheat)</li>
<li>Let some butter sit out for a few minutes, until it gets mushy.   Noone likes firm butter.</li>
<li>Slice some cheese into thin slices. I like medium chedder or  colby.</li>
<li>Get some thin slices of smaked turkey or other meat. I simply   used lunch meat from the deli.</li>
<li>Put it all together: bread, layer of cheese, layer of meat,   layer of cheese, and bread.</li>
<li>Then spread a large amount of butter evenly on the outside of the   bread.</li>
<li>Put a pan on the stove. Heat to medium-hot.</li>
<li>Grill until the bttom layer of cheese looks kinda soft. Flip and   repeat. Then flip once more for the fianl bit of toasting. Bread   should be a beautiful golden color.</li>
<li>Cut in half.</li>
<li>Eat.</li>
</ol>

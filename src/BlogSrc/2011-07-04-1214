I bought an inexpensive GPS Friday. It was $45 (plus $5 for a case) at CompUSA/TigerDirect yesterday. It is not the easiest thing to use, but if you make a point to bookmark all the places you are going before you leave the house, then navigating to them is fairly easy.

I'm tired of getting lost on the expressway.

We went to the NC State Zoo Saturday. It gets extra points for lots of walking paths. No reason to crowd the animals into one small area for lazy human's benefit.

Craigslist may have destroyed the market for used bicycle shops.

I'm getting my bicycle fixed up at the shop. Probably something I should have been keeping up on over the past decade. When I'm done it'll be like having a new bike.

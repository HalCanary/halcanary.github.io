<p>I bought an inexpensive GPS Friday.  It was $45 (plus $5 for a case) at CompUSA/TigerDirect yesterday.  It is not the easiest thing to use, but if you make a point to bookmark all the places you are going before you leave the house, then navigating to them is fairly easy.</p>
<p>I'm tired of getting lost on the expressway.</p>

<p>We went to the NC State Zoo Saturday.  It gets extra points for lots of walking paths.  No reason to crowd the animals into one small area for lazy human's benefit.</p>

<p>Craigslist may have destroyed the market for used bicycle shops.</p>

<p>I'm  getting my bicycle fixed up at the shop.  Probably something I should have been keeping up on over the past decade.  When I'm done it'll be like having a new bike.</p>

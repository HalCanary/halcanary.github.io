<p>How to install the Fedora Core 4 version of the default Clearlooks theme on Fedora Core 5 and later:</p>
<p><img src="/images/Clearlooks_FC4_example.png" alt="SCREENSHOT OF THEME" /></p>
<p>Begin by going to <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/">http://fedora.redhat.com/Download/</a> and find a mirror.  Navigate to the directory <code>core/4/i386/os/Fedora/RPMS/</code> to download the two rpm packages we need: gnome-themes-x.xx.x-x.xxx.rpm and gtk2-engines-x.x.x-x.xxxx.rpm</p>
<pre>mkdir workingfolder
cd workingfolder
rpm2cpio [PATH]/gnome-themes-2.10.1-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
rpm2cpio [PATH]/gtk2-engines-2.6.3-2.i386.rpm | cpio -id
cp -a usr/share/themes/Clearlooks Clearlooks_FC4</pre>
<p>Now we need to edit the files in the Clearlooks_FC4 directory to give this theme a new name so the Theme Manager doesn't get confused.  Edit the file <code>Clearlooks_FC4/index.theme</code>:</p>
<pre>[Desktop Entry]
Name=Clearlooks_FC4
Type=X-GNOME-Metatheme
Comment=Attractive Usability
Encoding=UTF-8

[X-GNOME-Metatheme]
GtkTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
MetacityTheme=Clearlooks_FC4
IconTheme=Clearlooks</pre>
<p>Edit the file <code>Clearlooks_FC4/metacity-1/metacity-theme-1.xml</code> and change one line:</p>
<pre>&lt;name&gt;Clearlooks_FC4&lt;/name&gt;</pre>
<p>Now let's wrap this up:</p>
<pre>mkdir -p ~/.themes
mv Clearlooks_FC4 ~/.themes
cd ..
rm -r workingfolder
gnome-theme-manager &amp;</pre>
<p>Or you could just download my copy of <a href="/pub/Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz">Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz</a>.</p>
<pre>mkdir -p ~/.themes
tar xzf Clearlooks_FC4.tar.gz -C ~/.themes/
gnome-theme-manager &amp;</pre>

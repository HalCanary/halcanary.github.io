90% of the time you use a `<hr>` you are putting a divider between sections or subsections that are already (or should already) be divided by `<h2>`'s or `<h3>`'s. Instead use `<div>`'s to break up sections and subsections. So

```HTML
<!--document.html-->
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<hr />

<h2>Blog</h2>
<p>Paragraph</p>
<hr />
```

becomes

```HTML
<!--document.html-->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Blog</h2>
  <p>Paragraph</p>
</div>
```

The following css will produce a `<hr>` style border:

```CSS
/* style.css */
div.section {
  border-bottom:
  solid 3px #000000 ;
}
````

At this point you can have more fun with the css, without touching the html any more. (Isn't that the point?) Try putting each `<div class="section">` in its own little colorful box.

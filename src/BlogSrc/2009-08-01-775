<p>In the energy-efficient future:</p>
<blockquote><p>Picture a Manhattan block in mid-December, crammed with high-rise apartment buildings full of lights, people, and warmth.  Several thousand people live on the block.  All of their electricity, the fuel for their daily lives, comes from a compact natural gas turbine running in an underground installation in the center of the blcok.,  The heat produced from the turbine is used to create hot water and warm the entire block.  Each one of these people would have an energy footprint with an efficiency above 90%, compared with the current 33% Americans now live at. </p>

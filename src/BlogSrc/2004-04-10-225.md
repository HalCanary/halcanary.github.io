I was smoking a cigarette with Sara and Kyle two days ago, and Kyle mentioned that he has six cups of coffee every morning.

**Six Cups.**

This is probably the secret of Kyle's successful life.

Yesterday I had a full pot of hot tea and a jug of cold tea. I felt very productive, and I was only able to sleep 7 hours. I'm going to do that every day.

 [![[login screen]](/images/thumb-login-scaled.png)](/images/login-scaled.png)The new motherboard and processor arived today, and I finished rebuilding my computer. It was an involved process that required me to take everything apart and put it all back together, repartition my hard drive (I had been wanting to do that for a while), and reinstall my OS. It seems to be working fine. I'd take a photo, but it all looks just like it did before the upgrade.

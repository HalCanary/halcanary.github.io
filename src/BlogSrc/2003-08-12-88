<p>Dan Simmons (of <em>Hyperion</em> fame) has written  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380978938/theworldofhalcan/"> his take on the <em>Iliad</em></a>.  I did not buy the book when I saw it in the store, because I've been  wasting too much money recently anyway, but I put it on hold at  <a href="http://madison.scls.lib.wi.us/">the public library</a>.</p>
<p>I always wanted to write a modern retelling of the <em>Iliad</em>, either a novel or a rock opera, but both would be out of reach of my skill.</p>

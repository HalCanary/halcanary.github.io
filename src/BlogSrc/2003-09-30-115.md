I am giving up on Debian Linux. I tried installing it for a headless server and it worked great--but was running a 2.2 kernel. So I install the 2.4.x kernel with apt-get, and reboot. Well, the install program modified lilo incorrectly and ran /sbin/lilo, so it was broken and failed to boot. I go in and fix lilo, and get it to boot the 2.4 kernel, but suddenly it no longer is loading the correct module for the net card. At this point I decided to give up on this.

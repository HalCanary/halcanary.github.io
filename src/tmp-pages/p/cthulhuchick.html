	WHO WILL BE EATEN FIRST?</p>

    <p><em>One day, while sitting in a Cafe...</em></p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> George, it's <b>vital</b> that you make the right
      decision before you die.</p>

    <p><em>George:</em> You're going to say I have to choose between God and
      the devil, right?</p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> WRONG!  The stars are right! The Elder Gods
      are going to rise and eat us all!</p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> Soon the evil spawn, who had slept for eons... will
      awaken to clear the earth of man!</p>

      strange aeons even death can die.&rdquo; - H.P.L.</p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> NO ONE will be saved! EVERYONE will die and mankind
      itself will come to a horrible end!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;...I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors
      that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and space, and of
      those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars that dream beneath
      the sea...&rdquo; - H.P.L.</p>
    </div>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> Soon the seas will turn red with the blood of the
      human race, as the unspeakable terrors come from beyond the
      gate, which is Yog Sothoth, to devour all th their path! Ia!
      Shub Niggutath!  Ia! Ia!</p>

    <p><em>George:</em> So if we're all gonna die, what difference does it
      make? Who cares?  Nothing I can do about it...or is there?!</p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em>  You're right George... It's hopeless.  But there is
      one thing we can hope for... TO BE EATEN FIRST!</p>

    <p><em>George:</em> BE EATEN FIRST?! What the fuck kind of advantage is
      that?!  Give me one good reason why I would WANT to be eaten
      first!  One Good reason!!!</p>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> Do you really want to stick around and watch the
      entire world be destroyed by evil creatures from beyond
      Hell?</p>

    <p><em>George:</em> Not really... Oh God... you're right... I don't want to
      see it all end!  I want to be eaten quickly!  What do I have to
      do to make my death a swift one?</p>

      such abysms of shricking and immemorial lunacy...&rdquo; -
      H.P.L.</p>
    </div>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> You must worship and sacrifice at the altar to appease
      the appetites of the Elder Gods!  Then you might hope for a fast
      death!</p>

    <p><em>Worshiping the Elder Gods...</em></p>

    <p><em>High Priest:</em> Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthuhlu R'lyeh

    <p><em>Sacrifice:</em> WAAAHH</p>

    <p><em>Worshiper (thinking):</em> Gasp... This can't be!</p>

    <p><em>Worshipers:</em> CTHULHU FHTAGN!</p>
    </div>

    <p><em>Old Man:</em> Chant invocations from the NECRONOMICON, the book of
      dead names written by the Mad Monk, Abdul Alhazred! Only
      then... on the dreaded day when they rise... Will you be eaten
      first!</p>

	The Elder Gods are coming and everyone is doomed!</p>

    <p>You might as well party and do all the shit you were always
      afraid to do!</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">
      NOBODY CAN SAVE YOU.<br />
      WE WILL ALL BE EATEN</p>

    <p>If you start to have dreams about cities where the geometry is
      all wrong and get inspired to make weird sculptures, do it!</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Don't worry about going mad.  There's no avoiding it.</li>
      <li>Be prepared for horrible visons and creatures that will
      chill you to the bone</li>
      <li>Remember... Yog Sothoth is the gate!</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>WHAT TO SAY:</b><br />
      Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthuhlu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
      Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthuhlu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
      Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthuhlu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.</p>

    <p>If you have done all this, and you go completely mad... the
      Elder Gods will eat you first! Or maybe not... maybe they'll
      torture you in their dank and rotting lairs,,, but you won't
      care by then because you'll be insane!  A shell of a human
      being! BWA HA HA HA HA!</p>

    <p><em>Just remember... That is not dead which can eternal
      lie... And with strange aeons even death can die. </em></p>

    <p><b>Help another person go mad with the knowledge of horrible
	evil! Give them the Necronomicon!</b></p>

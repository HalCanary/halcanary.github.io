  An interesting bit of history.  The Mathematics Research Center was
    the target of the 
    <a href="http://www.sit.wisc.edu/%7Epsohandbook/odds/bomb.htm">Sterling
    Hall Bombing</a> on  August 24th, 1970. The bomb did not go off
    anywhere near the MRC, and instead killed scientist Robert
    Fassnacht.  The MRC no longer exists, but this sign can be found
    hidden away in an office in Sterling Hall.  Fun scavenger hunt topic.

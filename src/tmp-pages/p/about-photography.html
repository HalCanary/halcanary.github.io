    Since August 2002, I've been using a Cannon Powershot A40.  (Other
    users of this model include
    <a href="http://nuclear.physics.wisc.edu/~chapman/pictures/">Mark
    Chapman</a> and  
    <a href="http://wwdn.textamerica.com/">Wil Wheaton</a>.)  From
    January 2000 to 2002, I used an APS camera, which I was unhappy
    with.  I didn't think the film quality was as good as 35mm, even
    if the film canisters were convenient.</p>

  <p>The A40 takes 1600x1200 photos.  I store photos on a 512 MB CF
    card; I can hold about 800 jpegs on it.  I have two adapter lenses
    for it: a wide angle and a telephoto.  If I bought a new camera,
    I'd want one with improved optics (maybe an SLR) and more
    megapixels.  Small cameras don't interest me.</p>

  <p>I do all of my photo editing on my Linux desktop, using gphoto2
    to transfer files off of the camera.  
    (<a href="/p/a40/">Outdated info on
    gphoto2</a>)  I edit photos using the Gimp and ImageMagick.

  <p>My usual process it to dump the original 2 megapixel images in a
    $HOME/Photos/Originals/ directory, 
    <a href="/archives/000179.html"> prepend the
    date</a>, and rotate if necessary.  
  </p>
  
  <div class="code">
<div class="codeheader">$HOME/bin/rotate-counter</div>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
for x in "$@"; do 
    convert -rotate -90 $x tmp.jpg
    mv $x unrotated_$x
    mv tmp.jpg $x
done</pre>
</div>

  <p>and</p>

  <div class="code">
<div class="codeheader">$HOME/bin/rotate-clock</div>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
for x in "$@"; do 
    convert -rotate 90 $x tmp.jpg
    mv $x unrotated_$x
    mv tmp.jpg $x
done</pre>
</div>

  <p>Then I copy the files into a working directory and make whatever
    changes I want to make before publishing to the web.  Many photos
    don't make it; about 30%--50% do.  At this point I'll crop and
    resize.  If the photo is poor quality, I'll scale it down to
    800x600.  If it is okay, I'll only scale it to 1024x768.  If it is
    excellent, I'll leave it at full resolution.
  </p>

  <p>I usually crop and resize with <a href="http://gimp.org">the
      Gimp</a>.  If no cropping is necessary, I'll just let imagemagick
      to do the work:</p>

  <div class="code">
<div class="codeheader">$HOME/bin/resize-1024</div>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
SIZE="1024x1024"
for x in "$@"; do 
    convert -size $SIZE $x \
        -resize $SIZE tmp.jpg
    mv $x fullsize_$x
    mv tmp.jpg $x
done</pre>
</div>


  <p>Next, I make a thumbnail.  Again, imagemagick's convert is your
    friend:</p>

  <div class="code">
<div class="codeheader">$HOME/bin/thumb</div>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
if [ &quot;$#&quot; -lt 1 ]; then
    echo &quot;Usage: thumb sourcefile[s]&quot;;
    exit 1
fi
PREFIX=&quot;/photos/&quot;
THUMB_PREFIX=&quot;thumb/&quot;
for file in &quot;$@&quot; ; do 
    OUT=$THUMB_PREFIX$file
    convert -size 120x120 $file \
	-resize 120x120 +profile &quot;*&quot; $OUT
    GEOM=`identify -format 'width=&quot;%w&quot; height=&quot;%h&quot;' $OUT`
    echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&quot;
    echo &quot;  &lt;a href=\&quot;$PREFIX$file\&quot;&gt;&quot;
    echo &quot;    &lt;img $GEOM alt=\&quot;[Thumb]\&quot; src=\&quot;$PREFIX$OUT\&quot; /&gt;&quot;
    echo &quot;  &lt;/a&gt;&quot;
    echo &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;
done</pre>
</div>

  <p>If I want to print a photo to hang on the wall, I'll go back to
    the original image and crop out a 8:10 (1200x1500) portion.  Once
    I get a enough to bother, I'll burn those images onto a CD and
    take it to the grocery store for development.  I usually print out
    8&quot;x10&quot;s.  At 2 megapixels, 8x10 is about as big as you
    can go.  8x10s cost less than $2 at Woodmans or Walmart; Walgreens
    will charge you $4.</p>

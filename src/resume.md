*   Software Tools: React, NPM, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, CMake, OpenGL
*   Operating systems: Unix and Linux workstations and servers, Android and iOS.
*   Specialties: scientific and numerical computing, scientific visualization,
    computer graphics, full-stack web development, microservices, databases.

## Education

*   University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, M.S. Computer Science, August 2013.
*   University of Wisconsin-Madison, B.S. Physics and Mathematics, May 2001.

## Experience

*   Senior Software Engineer, Voith Digital. 2020
    *   Full-stack software engineer for
        Voith OnCumulus Industrial Internet-of-Things project
        (<http://voith.com/corp-en/digital-solutions/oncumulus.html>).
    *   Worked on creating the Voith Paper Break Protector tool: using machine
        learning to predict potential industrial problems and display these
        risks to machine operators.
    *   React/JavaScript frontend.
    *   Go microservices backend.
    *   Agile development on a distributed, remote team.
*   Software Engineer, Google, Inc. 2013–2020
    *   Member of the Skia 2D graphic library (<https://skia.org/>) team.
    *   Created SkQP, a project to use Skia rendering tests to generate new
        Android Compatibility Test Suite tests for OpenGLES and Vulkan drivers,
        for Android Pie and Andoroid 10
        (<https://skia.org/dev/testing/skqp>).
    *   Maintained SkPDF, Skia's PDF generator used by Chrome printing and
        Android framework. Refactored entire code to use a fraction of the RAM,
        execute faster, be threadsafe and optionally multithreaded
        (<https://skia.org/user/sample/pdf>).
    *   Experience running, testing, debugging Skia software library on Linux,
        MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS.
    *   Wrote example and testing applications for Android and iOS, linking a
        native C++ library to Java (via JNI) or Objective-C (e.g.
        <https://halcanary.org/skottie-ios-app/>).
    *   Contributed to API documentation and examples.
    *   Created scripts in Python, Go, and Shell to automate tasks (e.g.
        <https://halcanary.org/git-sync-deps/>).
*   Research Assistant, UNC-Chapel Hill, Computer Science Department. 2011–2013
    *   Created novel tools for visualizations of high-dimensional statistical distributions.
    *   Built visualizations for scientific data (nuclear quantum-chromodynamic
        plasma simulation, meteorologic simulation, and cosmological galactic
        formation simulation datasets) using VTK and ParaView.
    *   Iteratively designed and developed the MADAI Distribution Sampling Tools
        (<https://halcanary.org/madai-dst/>)
        and the MADAI Visualization Workbench
        (<https://halcanary.org/madai-bench/>).
    *   Developed new VTK filters and ParaView macros.
    *   Collaborated with domain scientists to develop visualization and
        statistical product requirements.
*   Receiving Manager, Barnes & Noble. 2006–2011
*   College Math Tutor, Edgewood College. 2004–2005
*   Programmer and Student Researcher, UW-Madison Math Department. 2001–2004
*   Interface Analyst and Programmer, Epic Systems Corporation. 2001–2002
    *   Developed database interface software in InterSystems Caché;
        Installed and configured client’s software;.
        Resolved customer issues with troubleshootingr;
        Developed custom software for clients.
*   Undergraduate Researcher, UW-Madison Physics Department. 1999–2000

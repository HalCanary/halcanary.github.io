### Day 1

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-13-wow-001.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-13-wow-001.jpg)  
This is me wandering around Durotar. Dahboo?

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-13-wow-002.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-13-wow-002.jpg)  
This is me and Gangli.

My first vacation to Ogrimarr.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-13-wow-004.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-13-wow-004.jpg)  
Being dead.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-13-wow-005.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-13-wow-005.jpg)  
Fighting a raptor thing. I did all the work.

Astronomy.

### Day 2

 [![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-007.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-007.jpg)[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-008.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-008.jpg)  
More Durotar. Honestly, it's a crappy country. I'm never going back, except on christmas and easter.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-009.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-009.jpg)  
Where the warriors hang out. Loctar!

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-010.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-010.jpg)  
Here I'm fighting some sort of centaur thing. It was easy to kill.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-011.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-011.jpg)  
Dancing in the streets.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-012.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-012.jpg)  
Running out of Durotar as fast as possible.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-013.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-013.jpg)  
Look, grass! I had never seen grass before.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-014.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-014.jpg)  
Zug-zug. I'm an orc, what do you expect?

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-015.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-015.jpg)  
I do a lot of running. A lot.

 [![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-017.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-017.jpg)[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-14-wow-018.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-14-wow-018.jpg)  
Flying is better.

### Day 3

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-15-wow-019.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-15-wow-019.jpg)  
Look! A zeebra, I mean zhevra. Zehvras have horns and have more hit points.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-15-wow-020.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-15-wow-020.jpg)  
Again, I had to sneak a photo. Makes one want to dabble in the demonic arts.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-15-wow-021.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-15-wow-021.jpg)  
The people you meet!

### Day 4

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-16-wow-022.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-16-wow-022.jpg)  
Creepy place. North Barrons, I think.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-16-wow-023.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-16-wow-023.jpg)  
Really creepy place. I turned around and went somewhere safer

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-16-wow-024.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-16-wow-024.jpg)  
More flying. It's the only way to travel. Unless you want to go to some podunk town like Rachet. Then you have to walk.

 [![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-16-wow-025.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-16-wow-025.jpg)[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-16-wow-026.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-16-wow-026.jpg)  
The thing I like the most about being an Orc is killing things. Here I'm after a Lion and a dino thing.

### Day 5

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-027.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-027.jpg)  
By the river.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-028.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-028.jpg)  
Some kind of battle going on. I wisely avoided the front line. Why can't we all just get along?

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-029.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-029.jpg)  
Drinking alone in the corner of a pub. Yes it is **every day** again.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-030.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-030.jpg)  
Flying back from-or-to Thunder Bluff.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-031.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-031.jpg)  
I'm King of the mountain. Zug-zug.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-032.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-032.jpg)  
Again with the deadness. Dabooo.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-033.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-033.jpg)  
I killed a lot of those raptor things.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-034.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-034.jpg)  
Sitting down for a spell.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-035.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-035.jpg)  
Rachet at sundown.

[![[Thumb]](/photos/thumb/2005-01-17-wow-036.jpg)](/photos/2005-01-17-wow-036.jpg)  
The moon. I need a telescope. I wonder if I can buy those at the auction?

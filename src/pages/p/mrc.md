Mathematics Research Center
===========================

An interesting bit of history. The Mathematics Research Center was the target of
the [Sterling Hall Bombing](http://www.sit.wisc.edu/%7Epsohandbook/odds/bomb.htm)
on August 24th, 1970. The bomb did not go off anywhere near the MRC, and
instead killed scientist Robert Fassnacht. The MRC no longer exists, but this
sign can be found hidden away in an office in Sterling Hall. Fun scavenger hunt
topic.

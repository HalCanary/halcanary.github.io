Metaphotography. Photo of Mark photographing the line to get in the rally. We got in the line at the echo tap. The entrance was up near the central library. Later I'll put in a map.

There was a screen closeby. Here is Dave Grohl on the screen. He's not much of a speaker. Without the whole band, he is only rocking at 50% efficiency.

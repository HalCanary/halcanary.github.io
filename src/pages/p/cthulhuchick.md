>   _One day, while sitting in a Cafe..._ 
>   
>   _Old Man:_ George, it's **vital** that you make the right decision before you
>   die.
>   
>   _George:_ You're going to say I have to choose between God and the devil,
>   right?
>   
>   _Old Man:_ WRONG! The stars are right! The Elder Gods are going to rise and eat
>   us all!
>   
>   >   “In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.” - H. P. Lovecraft
>   
>   _Old Man:_ Soon the evil spawn, who had slept for eons... will awaken to clear
>   the earth of man!
>   
>   >   “That is not dead which can eternal lie... And with strange aeons even
>   >   death can die.” - H.P.L.
>   
>   _Old Man:_ NO ONE will be saved! EVERYONE will die and mankind itself will come to a horrible end!
>   
>   >   “...I shall never sleep calmly again when I think of the horrors that lurk
>   >   ceaselessly behind life in time and space, and of those unhallowed
>   >   blasphemies from elder stars that dream beneath the sea...” - H.P.L.
>   
>   _Old Man:_ Soon the seas will turn red with the blood of the human race, as the
>   unspeakable terrors come from beyond the gate, which is Yog Sothoth, to devour
>   all th their path! Ia! Shub Niggutath! Ia! Ia!
>   
>   _George:_ So if we're all gonna die, what difference does it make? Who cares?
>   Nothing I can do about it...or is there?!
>   
>   _Old Man:_ You're right George... It's hopeless. But there is one thing we can
>   hope for... TO BE EATEN FIRST!
>   
>   _George:_ BE EATEN FIRST?! What the fuck kind of advantage is that?! Give me
>   one good reason why I would WANT to be eaten first! One Good reason!!!
>   
>   _Old Man:_ Do you really want to stick around and watch the entire world be
>   destroyed by evil creatures from beyond Hell?
>   
>   _George:_ Not really... Oh God... you're right... I don't want to see it all
>   end! I want to be eaten quickly! What do I have to do to make my death a swift
>   one?
>   
>   >   “The thing cannot be described - there is no language for such abysms of
>   >   shricking and immemorial lunacy...” - H.P.L.
>   
>   _Old Man:_ You must worship and sacrifice at the altar to appease the appetites
>   of the Elder Gods! Then you might hope for a fast death!
>   
>   >   _Worshiping the Elder Gods..._ 
>   >   
>   >   _High Priest:_ Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthuhlu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!
>   >   
>   >   _Sacrifice:_ WAAAHH
>   >   
>   >   _Worshiper (thinking):_ Gasp... This can't be!
>   >   
>   >   _Worshipers:_ CTHULHU FHTAGN!
>   
>   
>   _Old Man:_ Chant invocations from the NECRONOMICON, the book of dead names
>   written by the Mad Monk, Abdul Alhazred! Only then... on the dreaded day
>   when they rise... Will you be eaten first!

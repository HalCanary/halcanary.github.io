Proposals for new state flags
=============================

### Virginia

Rob Balder, creator of [_PartiallyClips_](http://www.partiallyclips.com/), suggested that no matter how boring the flag of Virginia is, it is still cool because it featured a female human breast. ([the discussion](http://hwc.livejournal.com/51754.html))

Andrew Rogers suggests scrapping the original flag---which features---the [state seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Virginia) designed by George Mason---for [something more geometrical](http://www.andrewrogers.net/Flags/new_state_flags.htm#Virginia_).

I still say you could jazz up the original design just a bit and make something very good:

### Wisconsin

While we're redesigning state flags, why not have a go at my current home state's flag?

### Florida

New:

This is a completely novel approach to a flag. If you are going to have a fancy nine-color image on your flag, then why not make that image big enough that everyone can see it? It's not as if this flag would be more expensive: in fact, it uses fewer colors than the original!

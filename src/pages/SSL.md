Hal's SSL Stuff
===============

This page contains a lot of my work for [Jim
Propp](http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/)'s [Spatial Systems
Laboratory](http://faculty.uml.edu/jpropp/SSL/) in Spring 2001, Fall 2003,
and Spring 2004.

### The Proof of the Baxter Permutation Conjecture

My paper, _Aztec Diamonds and Baxter Permutations_ can be found on the ArXiv
here: [arXiv:math.CO/0309135](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0309135). On
2004-03-02, I submitted it to the _Electronic Journal of Combinatorics_.

(Addendum: published as: [Hal Canary. “Aztec Diamonds and Baxter Permutations.” The
Electronic Journal of Combinatorics 17 (2010), #R105](https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v17i1r105))

### Rotor Router Modle Applets

The final version of my Rotor Router Applet incorporates all of the precursor
applets that went by the names: PI-Computer, Rotor-Router Version 0.x,
Finite-Graph Applet, 2D-Aggregation Applet, 2d-Walk Applet, and Rotor-Graphs
Applet. The precursors can be found
[here](../mathapplets/rotor-router-archive/).

**Current Version:** [Rotor Router Applet
v1.0](../mathapplets/rotor-router-model/). This is the July 2004 version of the
Applet.

### Grove Shuffler

I haven't done much work with the grove system, but you can read about it in
Carroll & Speyer's article "The Cube Recurrence"
([arXiv:math.CO/0403417](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0403417)).

Kyle Petersen's Grove Shuffler Applet: [Grove Shuffler
v0.3](../mathapplets/groveshuffler/groveshuffler-v03/). Version 0.3 was
completed 2003-10-10. Looks Good. Source:
[tarball](../mathapplets/groveshuffler/groveshuffler-v03.tgz) and
[zipfile](../mathapplets/groveshuffler/groveshuffler-v03.zip). And here is
Grove Shuffler [v0.2 archived

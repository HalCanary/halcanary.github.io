<h1>TOAD Shuffler Help</h1>

<div class="help">

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
A TOAD is a Tiling Of an Aztec Diamond with domino tiles; a domino is
a 2-by-1 rectangle.  Set &ldquo;Initial Size&rdquo; to 2.  Then click
on &ldquo;New AD.&rdquo; TOAD Shuffler will now display an random
Aztec Diamond of order 2.  Hit &ldquo;Iterate Stage&rdquo; several
times.  Each time, it will display a larger Aztec Diamond, tiled with
dominoes.
</p>

<p>
An order <i>n</i> Aztec diamond has 2^(<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>+1)/2)
different tilings.  This program will produce a random tiling from the
uniform distribution of all such tilings.
</p>

<h2>What are the rules?</h2>

<p>
There are three steps to &ldquo;growing&rdquo; a TOAD via the EKLP shuffling
algorithm.  They are filling, destruction, and sliding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rule for Filling:</i>
<br>
Divide the untiled area into squares.  Then randomly tile each square
with either two horizontal dominoes or two vertical dominoes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rule for Destruction:</i>
<br>
If a north-going domino is about to collide with a south-going domino,
delete them both.  Same for east and west-going dominoes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Rule for Sliding:</i>
<br>
Move the horizontal dominoes north or south, depending on their color.
Move the vertical dominoes east or west, depending on their color.
</p>

<h2>What do the colors mean?</h2>

<p>The colors of each tile represent the direction that they will move in
the sliding step of the shuffling algorithm.  But the colors come from
the position of the tiles.  Imagine the Aztec diamond as a large
checkerboard where each domino overlaps two squares, a black and a
white square.  if the black square is to the left of the white square,
color it one color, if the black square is to the right, color it
another color. The same applies to the two colors of vertical dominoes.
</p>

<!--
<h2>What is a FPL?</h2>

<p>
A FPL (Fully Packed Loop) is a way to represent an ASM (Alternating
Sign Matrix.)  Each TOAD corresponds to two ASMs.  If you turn on
&ldquo;Show FPL,&rdquo; TOAD Shuffler will display the two FPLs that
correspond to the two ASMs that correspond to the TOAD.

      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</p>

    <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Preamble</h3>

    <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
    to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
    your programs, too.</p>

    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

    <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
    you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.</p>

    <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

    <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
    we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
    original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
    on the original authors' reputations.</p>

    <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at
    all.</p>

    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.</p>

    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h3>

    <p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
    distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
    "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work
    based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work
    under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or
    a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
    included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee
    is addressed as "you".</p>

    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
    (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
    is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

    <p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.</p>

    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.</p>

    <p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
    portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

    <p><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

    <p><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
    under the terms of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive
    use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
    including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is
    no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
    users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
    the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the
    Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
    announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
    an announcement.)</p>

    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
    it.</p>

    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.</p>

    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>

    <p><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

    <p><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
    physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
    copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
    terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
    software interchange; or,</p>

    <p><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
    accord with Subsection b above.)</p>

    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.</p>

    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

    <p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
    to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
    will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
    parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.</p>

    <p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.</p>

    <p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
    the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.</p>

    <p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
    patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
    issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
    agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
    If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
    obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
    then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
    example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
    redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly
    or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it
    and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.</p>

    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.</p>

    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.</p>

    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
    the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
    version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
    published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other
    free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to
    the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
    the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
    we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by
    the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
    free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
    generally.</p>

    <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

    <p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

    <p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
    PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
    FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.</p>

    <h3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

    <h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

    <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.</p>

    <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
      Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author</p>

    <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
      modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
      as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
      of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>

    <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

    <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
    mail.</p>

    <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
      type <code>show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
      to redistribute it under certain conditions; type</code>show c'
      for details.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The hypothetical commands \<code>show w' and \</code>show c' should show the
    appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
    commands you use may be called something other than \<code>show w' and
    \</code>show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
    suits your program.</p>

    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
    if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
      interest in the program `Gnomovision'
      (which makes passes at compilers) written
      by James Hacker.</p>

    <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
    into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library,
    you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
    applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
    <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public
    License</a> instead of this
    License.</p>
    </blockquote>

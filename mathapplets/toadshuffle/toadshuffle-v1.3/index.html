<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>
A TOAD is a Tiling Of an Aztec Diamond with domino tiles; a domino is
a 2-by-1 rectangle.  Set &ldquo;Initial Size&rdquo; to 2.  Then click
on &ldquo;New AD.&rdquo; TOAD Shuffler will now display an random
Aztec Diamond of order 2.  Hit &ldquo;Iterate Stage&rdquo; several
times.  Each time, it will display a larger Aztec Diamond, tiled with
dominoes.
</p>

<p>
An order <i>n</i> Aztec diamond has 2^(<i>n</i>(<i>n</i>+1)/2)
different tilings.  This program will produce a random tiling from the
uniform distribution of all such tilings.
</p>

<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
 
<p>
There are three steps to &ldquo;growing&rdquo; a TOAD via the EKLP shuffling
algorithm.  They are filling, destruction, and sliding.
</p>
 
<p>
<i>Rule for Filling:</i>
<br>
Divide the untiled area into squares.  Then randomly tile each square
with either two horizontal dominoes or two vertical dominoes.
</p>
 
<p>
<i>Rule for Destruction:</i>
<br>
If a north-going domino is about to collide with a south-going domino,
delete them both.  Same for east and west-going dominoes.
</p>
 
<p>
<i>Rule for Sliding:</i>
<br>
Move the horizontal dominoes north or south, depending on their color.
Move the vertical dominoes east or west, depending on their color.  
</p>

<h2>What do the colors mean?</h2>

<p>The colors of each tile represent the direction that they will move in
the sliding step of the shuffling algorithm.  But the colors come from
the position of the tiles.  Imagine the Aztec diamond as a large
checkerboard where each domino overlaps two squares, a black and a
white square.  if the black square is to the left of the white square,
color it one color, if the black square is to the right, color it
another color. The same applies to the two colors of vertical dominoes.
</p>

<h2>What is a FPL?</h2>

<p>
A FPL (Fully Packed Loop) is a way to represent an ASM (Alternating
Sign Matrix.)  Each TOAD corresponds to two ASMs.  If you turn on
&ldquo;Show FPL,&rdquo; TOAD Shuffler will display the two FPLs that
correspond to the two ASMs that correspond to the TOAD.

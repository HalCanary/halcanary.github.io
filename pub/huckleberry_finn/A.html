ADVENTURES
<br>
OF
<br>
HUCKLEBERRY FINN
<br>
(Tom Sawyer's Comrade)
<br>
By Mark Twain
</h1>
<h2>EXPLANATORY</h2>
<p>
IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit:  the Missouri negro
dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the
ordinary “Pike County” dialect; and four modified varieties of this
last. The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion, or by
guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and
support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.
</p>
<p>
I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers
would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and
not succeeding.

<h2>CHAPTER THE LAST</h2>
<p>
THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time
of the evasion?—what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?
And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got
Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.
</p>
<p>
We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,
they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:
</p>
<p>
“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you?—what I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan'?  I <em>tole</em> you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en
I <em>tole</em> you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich <em>agin</em>; en it's
come true; en heah she is!  <em>dah</em>, now! doan' talk to <em>me</em>—signs is
<em>signs</em>, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be
rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!”
</p>
<p>
And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get
none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got
it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
</p>
<p>
“No, he hain't,” Tom says; “it's all there yet—six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.  Hadn't when I come
away, anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
Jim says, kind of solemn:
</p>
<p>
“He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.”
</p>
<p>
I says:
</p>
<p>
“Why, Jim?”
</p>
<p>
“Nemmine why, Huck—but he ain't comin' back no mo.”
</p>
<p>
But I kept at him; so at last he says:
</p>
<p>
“Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a
man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat
wuz him.”
</p>
<p>
Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't
nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd
a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it,
and ain't a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the
Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me
and sivilize me, and I can't stand it.  I been there before.
</p>
<p>
THE END. YOURS TRULY, <em>HUCK FINN</em>.

<p>I went to early vote this morning.  This is the first of two Saturdays that the polls are open.  It seems to me that they should be open Sundays as well.</p>
<p>There are five early voting locations in this county, so I had to drive a bit to get there, but the convenience of being able to vote on a Saturday morning made it worth it.</p>
<p>I had to wait in line less than half an hour; I should have timed it.  The line went out the door of the county supervisor of elections branch office and into the next door, some kind of abandoned store. </p>
<p>Since there were voters from all precincts there (all in different congressional districts, state senate districts, state house districts, county commission districts, fire control districts, and sub-municipalities), they printed out ballots as needed.  To get our identity, they swiped the magnetic strip on our state ID (driver license).</p>
<p>After filling out the bubbles on the ballots, we fed them into a machine that read them.  There was no feedback on whether the machine read the ballots correctly.  I have to hope that somebody performs spot-checks to verify that the optical scan machines are functioning properly.</p>

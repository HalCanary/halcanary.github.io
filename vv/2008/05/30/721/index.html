<p>Rules of the game:</p>
<p>You can change anything you want about the federal tax code, but your changes must be revenue-neutral. No starve-the-beast proposals.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>My suggestion.</p>
<p>--> Let A be the annual income a full-time (40-hour/week) minimum-wage worker would make.</p>
<p>--> Let B be the annual income of the median worker. (50% of Americans make less than him, 50% more.)</p>
<p>--> Let C be the income of the 67-percentile worker. (66.7% of Americans make less than him, 33.3% more.)</p>
<p>Replace current federal taxes with the following:</p>
<p>1) Increase the EITC (earned income tax credit) to a very large level. Make it 0 at zero income, maximum at A, and get down to 0 again at B.</p>
<p>2) Income tax of 50% on all income greater than C, minus philanthropic donations.</p>
<p>3) A huge tax on carbon emissions. On the order of $10 per gallon of gasoline, with an carbon-equivalent tax on coal, diesel, natural gas, etc.</p>
<p>4) A general policy that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax">negative externalities are taxed equal to the indirect cost</a> to society. Carbon emissions are the biggest part of this at the moment, but I like the idea of pollution taxes greater than the cost of totally cleaning up the pollution. And a big tax on non-reusable goods.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>UPDATE: Hey, there's a website for <a href="http://www.carbontax.org/">revenue-neutral carbon taxes</a>!</p>

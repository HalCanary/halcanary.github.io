<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<p>All of the world's librarians should collaborate on a giant electronic archive of humanity's written work.</p>

<p>If our civilization collapses, this archive can provide a somewhat complete record of human knowledge and works for the future.</p>

<p>Copies of the archive would be stored by anyone who wishes to make a copy.</p>

<p>It would be updated continuously, with annual releases.</p>

<p>Books, magazines, newspapers, science journals, scripts, screenplays, laws, public records, written music, letters, pamphlets, transcripts, as well as text published electronicly would be included.</p>

<p>It would primarily consist of plain text documents, (with static images illustrations as needed). Original scans and layout would not be included due to storage limitations.</p>

<p>The archive would consist of public-domain works, as well as works with appropriate free licenses.</p>

<p>I expect that it will be very large, and I hope it inspires new technology for read-only storage.</p>

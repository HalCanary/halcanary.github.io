<p>I bought a copy of Red Hat 9 today. I've got the hang of installing  new linux distros. Just don't format over the /home and /usr/local  partitions and remember where you wrote down the phone number for your  ppp connection. And don't forget that the modem is /dev/ttyS4, not  /dev/ttyS0; that mistake cost me an hour.</p>
<p>My review: Not much different than 8.0. It feels more like a point  release. Does not come with Windowmaker, so I'm not sure how well that  will work on a older machine. I'm back to using Bluecurv-themed Gnome.   It works okay. </p>
<p>Problems with Gnome 2:  </p>
<ol>
<li>No shortcut key to logout. (I submitted a bug report on that.) </li>
<li>needs to run 'xrdb $HOME/.Xdefaults' on login. (Fixable)</li>
<li>Not as fast loading as Windowmaker (but faster than Gnome    1.x).</li>
<li>No native gtk music player. Xmms simply isn't good enough;    it looks like crap.</li>
<li>Fonts in Open Office need fixing. I hear that Ximian is working    on this.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make a usable system, I have to install the following software in /usr/local: </p>
<ol>
<li>Phoenix with nice fonts - browser.</li>
<li>Flash plugin for Phoenix.</li>
<li>mpg123 - tui mp3 player.</li>
<li>mplayer and w32 codecs - video player.</li>
<li>scripts for '/sbin/ifup ppp$N' and '/sbin/ifdown ppp$N'.</li>
<li>BladeEnc - mp3 encoder. (Yes, I know about Ogg Vorbis; but until    both of my mp3 players support it, it doesn't work. I keep waiting    for Apple to release a software update for the iPod for Ogg.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I'm suprised at how few things need to be in /usr/local. I went through and cleaned up that partition for the first time in years. </p>
<p>To do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to get my iPod to play nice with linux. With previous kernel    versions, using the firewire card caused kernel errors. Ick.</li>
<li>Get dvd playback to work nicely. The easy solution is to go buy    a video card with mpeg-2 decoding on it. Why does software    decoding work so much nicer under Windows than Linux?</li>
</ol>

<p>It snowed this morning! In April! Crazyness!</p>

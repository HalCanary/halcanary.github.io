<p>Yesterday, I slept in some, but not as much as I thought I would need. Washed some dishes. Burned two cd's from <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune's</a> Electronica mp3 collection. Caught 9:50 bus.</p>
<p>Went to class. Learned about free groups and free products.</p>
<p>If I were a buddist philosopher, I would write a book called <em>The Big Book of Buddah</em>. (It's an alliteration, see?)</p>
<p>Tried to study for ssl, didn't learn much, but instead I took nap. Nice nap.</p>
<p>Went to SSL. Today was individual meetings with Jim. Much more fun was brainstorming with the kids. (I include John as a kid even though he is probably five years older than me.) We decided to meet Monday at 3:30 for more fun. I don't want to be a serious mathematician if it means being serious all the time.</p>
<p>Put out <a href="/SSL/">v1.2 of TOAD Shuffler</a>. (Took ~2 hours) </p>
<p>Went to store and bought many 2liters of diet dr.p.</p>

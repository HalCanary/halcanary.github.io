<p>I'm down at the terrace at 1am, doing a bit of studying for the gre. I was suprised at how many people were here at midnight, when the place was closed.  But by now everyone has gone. I've got my wireless internet and am as productive as I would be anywhere. I don't see anywhere I can steal power from. Too bad. </p>
<p>It's a beatiful night. Again I remember why I live in Madison.</p>

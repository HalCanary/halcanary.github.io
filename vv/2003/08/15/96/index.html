<p>As I've mentioned before, I'm putting together a media pc. I started  with my old computer, <em>dalek</em>, and put it in a new case. Then I  hooked the video card's s-video output up to my television and the  sound up to my stereo. When I tried to turn it on two days ago nothing  happened. So I went to bed. Yesterday, I opened it up and found that  the power supply was not plugged into the motherboard snugly. After fixing that, it booted.</p>
<p>It is running Knoppix off of a CD. Right now, XFree86 is not sending  the TV a good signal, so I'm stuck in console mode. So no watching  movies on dalek yet. But I did pop in a CD full of mp3's and  it could play them using mpg123.</p>
<p>To Do: </p>
<ol>
<li>Get XFree86 working.</li>
<li>Play DVDs</li>
<li>Get my router working.</li>
<li>Get dalek onto the network.</li>
<li>Share music &amp; video from lensman's harddrive using samba.</li>
<li>Play video games with emulators.</li>
</ol>
<p>That photo I just took is meant to show one thing. Since it's a  black case, it doesn't stand out much. Which is exactly how things  should be. It's just another component in my A/V system. Eventually,  the system should consist of (1) a media pc, (2) an amplifier &amp;  speakers and (3) a screen.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2004-12-02:</strong> A while back I broke down and threw a 8 GiB HDD into dalek and installed FC.  This eventually got 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 working.  I use scp instead of samba.  I just don't trust samba.</p>

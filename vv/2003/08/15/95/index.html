<p>For a while, I've been upset at the sorry state of emacs. It is not  <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">HIG-compliant</a>,  and it doesn't use anti-aliased fonts. It is really a pain to remap all of the keybindings for emacs. And when you have three or more  buffers open, it's a pain to switch between them.</p>
<p>So I've decided to abandon the one true editor.</p>
<p>First candidate for Hal's new editor: <strong>vim</strong>. I quickly dropped  that when I realized that I didn't want to learn a whole new set of  arcane keybindings.</p>
<p>Candidate 2: <strong>gedit</strong>. The default editor for my desktop of choice: Gnome. It has anti-aliased fonts and tabs, which I like, but  lacks any other useful features.</p>
<p>Candidate 3:  <a href="http://eturquin.free.fr/beaver/"><strong>beaver</strong></a>.  Beaver is a gtk+ editor that tries to be exactly what I want. It has tabs, syntax highlighting, gtk2 toolkit, and anti-aliased  fonts. But it's still rough around the edges. I think it really  wants to be adopted by the Gnome project.</p>
<p>Candidate 4: <strong>kate</strong>. Kate is the advanced editor for KDE.  I don't really like KDE as much as Gnome, but ome of tha apps are  okay. KDE has one great feature that is integreated into all of  its apps: network transparency. At the command line, I can type</p>
<pre>kate ftp://XXX@halcanary.org/public_html/index.cgi</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>kate sftp://ups.physics.wisc.edu/home/hal/note-.txt </pre>
<p>and it asks for a password and opens up the document in a local  window. This is <em>beautiful</em>. It also has really good syntax highlighting. It does not have tabs, but it is easy to switch between  buffers with alt-rightarrow and alt-leftarrow. It's also easy to edit  the keybindings. I just made ctrl-w an alternate for close, and  ctrl-[shift]-tab for forward[backward].</p>
<p>Also note that KDE is the desktop on Knoppix. Anywhere I can stick in  a Knoppix CD, I can use kate to edit files locally.</p>

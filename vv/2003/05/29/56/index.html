<p><a href="/art/devil-04.jpg"><img alt="" src="/art/devil-04s.jpg" /></a> I stayed up til dawn last night. Insomnia led to one of the most productive days in months. I spent a lot of time cleaning up the mp3's on my hard drive. The problem was that I had not decided how to go about organizing them until I had already massed a couple of gigs of them. Each file should have a correct id3 tag and a filename of <br /> $HOME/Music/[genre]/[artist]/[artist]_-_[album]_[track]_[title].mp3. </p>
<p>A lot of my old files had filenames that included spaces or non-ascii characters. These are a pain in the ass when your main mp3 player is command line mpg123. What kind of idiot came up with the concept of spaces in filenames anyways? </p>
<p>I now have 8 240 250 880 bytes of music. </p>
<p>I also paid my bills, cleaned my apartment, did dishes, folded laundry, threw out old clothes, and reorganized parts of my closet.</p>
<p>As of June 2, my 273 phone number will cease to work. When I get back to town at the end of the summer, I will finally be forced to get high speed internet access. I find it off that internet connection costs never seem to go down. You would think that as the technology continued to mature, costs would go down.    I have some bad habits when it comes to keeping track of pieces of paper. I tend to organize them by placing them in little stacks and the forgetting about them until I realize that all of these stcks of paper have now bneen mixed together again and need to be resorted before I can find anything again. If only I could just throw things away sooner. </p>
<p>I have reciepts for every dollar I've spent for the past six years. I have never once looked at a single one after it went into the pile.</p>

<h4>high-speed internet</h4>
<p>I got cable modem service last week. This is the first time I've had a high speed connection at my house, and here is what I think:</p>
<p>All in all, it's a good idea. A bit expensive, but these things can be budgeted for.</p>
<h4>bittorrent</h4>
<p><a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a> is awesome. Because the load is distributed evenly, you can get the full use of whatever bandwidth you have.</p>
<p>I love how the program is so minimalistic. Compare to Kazaa, which is a huge executable that only seems to run on Windows. It achieves this minimality by using existing httpd clients/servers to not only deliver the .torrent metafiles, but also information about and links to the torrents in normal text/html. </p>
<p>It's annoying when servers deliver .torrent files as text/plain instead of application/x-bittorrent.</p>
<h4>hardware addiction</h4>
<p>With all of the crap I'm downloading, I may need to get a new hard drive soon. Right now I have two 30 GB drives. If I replaced one of them with a 120 GB drive, then I'd have two and a half times as much storage. If I had a mobo with more than two IDE channels, I could have more than four devices. But I really shouldn't spend any more money on hardware. Instead I'll spend it on blank CD-Rs.</p>
<h4>the urge to game</h4>
<p>I read a review of <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/">Star Wars Galaxies</a> the other day. Made me want to see the game. Explore it for a few weeks, at least. Their pricing model discourages the casual gamer. It's $12 to $15 per month plus $50 up front for the game. If they were really confidant that the game was fun, it would be $20 up front for the first month and $20/per month after that. If they can keep a gamer for a year they've more than broke even. But $50 is a bit much for a game that I might want to stop playing the first month.</p>
<p>And I'm certainly not paying $80 for the collectors edition since the standard edition is sold out. `</p>
<p>This is a well established business principle. Give away the razor and profit on the blades.</p>
<p>I't just as well that I'm not going to get the game. I'd just have to use windows anyways. And that would be distasteful.</p>

<p>It was cool last niught and I had my window open. I slept well and woke  up 90 seconds before the alarm. Somehow that inspired me to have the  most interesting dream. </p>
<p>I was flying somewhere, after not flying in years. I was still afraid  of surfacte-to-air missiles, but fiinally decided that I could take a  chance on air travel again. I had jsut got on the plane when I had a vision. The plane was not going to make it to its destination. I got  off of the plane before it left the gate. As I was leaving, I noiticed that the pilot who was boarding looked drunk or ill. </p>
<p>As I stod in the terminal, I watched the plane take off, and then crash  into the ground. My fears were justified. I got out my cell and  called for a ride home. I immediately got a couple of messages from  people who wanted to know if I was alive. </p>
<p>As I walked out of the terminal, a female security guard asked me to come with her. I obliged, until she led me into a scary part of the airport. Then I said I didn't want to come with her, or I would be happy to talk to her, but maybe in a nice conference room somewhere.  Another security guard walked up then, noticed that I was making trouble and pulled a gun on me. The first guard told the second that he shouldn't point a gun at me, but he didn't listen. I fought the  second guard, and managed to shoot him in the fight. I then unloaded the pistol and threw it away. I then told the first guard to get lost.  I ran.</p>
<p>When I got outside, my ride pulled up. This was a skinny punky girl  who only appears in this dream. She was driving crazy and I told her  that we had to make a fast getaway. She stepped on it and drove down  the wrong way down one of those one way drives at the airport. I  mentioned that we would probably attract less attention if we went the  right way and drove casual.</p>
<p>That's where I woke up.</p>

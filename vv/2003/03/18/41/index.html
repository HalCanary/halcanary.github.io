<p>Last night I had a dream that I was fighting zombies. <em>We rushed upstairs in the house where we were holed up, 'cause it's so easy for zombies to jump in through the downstairs windows. Now we only had a narrow staircase to defend. Luckilly it had a door at the top, too. The zombies were armed with derringers, so the usual thing that happened was that the zombies would shoot and miss, then we'd throw a heavy lamp at them and they's be knocked silly for a while but we couldn't steal their guns, cause they only had one shot. So we ended up having to hack the zombies up with a big knife or something. Eventually all of the people I was with were killed or zombiefied, and I was on the run. The funny thing about the whole thing was that neither I or the zombied had any special strength. In fact, they were kinda slow and easy to confuse.</em> </p>
<p><em>Then I met the head zombie. He was slowly turning into an alien. His skin was becoming hard and scaly, and his fingers were becoming pointy, and his face was developing a beaklike structure. (Kind of like a Nivin Protector.) If this was a bad sci-fi movie, then there would be all of this scientific bullshit about space-born virus inteligence. But there wasn't, and that was refreshing. It helped that there was no know-it-all scientist character int he story at all.</em> </p>
<p>Then I woke up.</p>
<hr />
<p>What did I do before that? I got home at 1am, made some dinner, and listened to the BBC World Service on FM90.7 for a while until they started talking about sports. </p>
<hr />
<p>What did I do before that? I went to see  <a href="http://www.thekissers.com/">the Kissers</a> play at Luther's. Good show.  </p>
<hr />
<p>I'm thinking of doing the Appalachian Trail (or a portion thereof) this summer. This seems like it might be a logistical challenge.</p>

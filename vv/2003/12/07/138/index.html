<p>Had a couple of odd dreams recently.  A few nights ago, I had a dream that Iwas driving somewhere with Mark in his car and for some reason he had a trunk full of old clothes he wanted to donate to some organization.  It was sunday morning and the usual suspects (goodwill, st. vinnie's) were closed. We just wated to get rid of them, so we decided to stop by a church that was supposed to have a place to take old clothes in the basement.</p>
<p>Mark had the wonderful idea of driving his car into the freight elevator to make this quicker, but then we couldn't get it out, and meanwhile we couldn't find where we were supposed to go and the church was filling up with people and it was one of these mega-churches and we were lost in the basement and they were mad that we had left a car in the elevator, but we couln't even <em>find</em> the elevator!</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream that I was wandering downtown and I wadered into a house and there were some evil people in the house and the house was full of secret passeges.  Let this be a lesson to you:  don't enter other people's houses!</p>
<p>The use of run-on sentences is deliberate when describing dreams.</p>

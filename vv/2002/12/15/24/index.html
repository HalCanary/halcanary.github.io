<p><strong>Site Update!</strong> (I wonder who reads this, anyway?)</p>
<p>I've been going back and rewriting the perl backend of this page.  You shouldn't be able to tell a difference, but the code is a lot  cleaner now. I've moved all of the reusable code into a  <code>.pm</code> file so I can now knock out new cgi scripts much more  quickly. </p>
<p>Yea! Reusable Code!</p>
<p>There's now a <a href="https://halcanary.org/blogsubmit.cgi">Blog  Submission</a> form, which will only work if you are logged in. And  I'm the only one with a login right now. So if I know you, and you are  looking for a place to log your thoughts, send me a note. </p>

<p><a href="/photos/2002-12-15-vaio-w-kbd.jpg">  <img alt="" src="/photos/thumb/2002-12-15-vaio-w-kbd.jpg" /></a> I got sick of the tiny keyboard on my tiny notebook, so I went  shopping for a keybord to throw in my suitcase when I travel. I need a full sized USB keyboard that doesn't take up more space than it has to. Since I only have one USB port on my notebook, I also need a USB hub.  The ideal thing would be a keyboard with a built in hub, like Apple  has. So I wandered around CompUSA looking for such a thing. It turns  out that half of the PC keyboards out there still have PS/2  connectors. And all of the rest are huge, with 20 unnessisary buttons. </p>
<p>So I ended up buying an Apple Pro Keyboard. It works perffectly. The only thing it lacks is a context-menu button. And the alt and start buttons are reversed. But I can deal with those issues. Apple could make a killing if they would market thier keyboards at PC users. </p>
<p>Yea! Hardware Standards!</p>

<p>How? </p>
<p><strong>Can you elaborate on that?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What makes you believe elaborate on what?</strong></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p><strong>I would appreciate it if you would continue.</strong></p>
<p>Continue what?</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say continue what?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
<p>You don't make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of problems at school that you are going through all this?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not in school right now.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about your school.</strong></p>
<p>I'm not in school right now.</p>

<p><strong>Are you annoyed that I ask that?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>
<p>I am not annoyed that you asked that.</p>
<p><strong>Is it because I asked that that you came to me?</strong></p>
<p>How could that be wht I came to you?  You asked me AFTER I came to you.</p>
<p><strong>Are you sure that I asked you after youcame to me?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Go on, don't be afraid.</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand the question.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier you said I asked that?</strong></p>
<p>Is that a question?</p>
<p><strong>I need a little more detail please.</strong></p>
<p>You used a question mark at the end of a declarative statement.  I don't know how to respond to that.</p>
<p><strong>You're being a bit brief, perhaps you could go into detail.</strong></p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p><strong>How do you reconcile any hobbies you have?</strong></p>
<p>What do hobbies have to do with anything?  And why do hobbies need reconciling?</p>
<p><strong>When did you first know that do hobbies need reconciling?</strong></p>
<p>I don't know that hobbies need reconciling?</p>
<p><strong>Is it because of your sex life that you say you do not know that hobbies need reconciling?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>

<p>Mark uses the term worship to refer to any religious gathering. I say it is limited to religious veneration, submission, adoration, or reverence of a diety (2,7,10) or as a metaphor (1,3,5,6,8).  I need to discuss this further with him.  I don't remember exactly what he said.</p>
<p>The point is: if I was a diety, I would not want to be worshipped.  This is why I don't like the term.</p>

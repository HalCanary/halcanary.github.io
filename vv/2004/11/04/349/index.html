<blockquote><p>I got a very clear picture of his [GWB's] base constituency when having a discussion over lunch with some co-workers about our favorite children's shows. I was commenting on how much I liked Sesame Street, and one woman (a very vocal Christian conservative) said, "Oooh.. Sesame Street is too tolerant for me". To my horror, several other women nodded their heads in agreement. I guess I didn't even think there was such a thing as too tolerant.</p>

<p>Remember, in many red states, it's perfectly legal to discriminate against someone because they are gay.</p>

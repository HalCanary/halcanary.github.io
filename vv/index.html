<p>I'd like to propose a four-part election to replace our current system:</p>

<p>(1) APPLICATION. On day one of the campaign, eligible citizens can apply for
the office, at the local, state, or federal board of elections (depending on
the office). The application window closes after seven days, at which time the
board publishes a list of applicants. </p>

<p>(2) NOMINATION.  At this time, any eligible voter can go to their local board
of elections office and sign a petition to nominate any number of applicants.
After four weeks, the petitions are closed, and the N candidates with the most
signatures for each office receive a nomination.  (N is set by law, and can be
different for each office; N > 2.) The board of elections publishes the lists
of nominees at this time. </p>

<p>(3) PRIMARY ELECTION.  After six weeks to campaign, a primary election is held.
The ballots are a ranked-choice voting system.  All but two candidates for each
office are eliminated using instant-runoff rules.  The polls should be open for
a week.</p>

<p>(4) GENERAL ELECTION.  After a final four weeks of campaigning, a general
election is held between the two candidates for each office. No write-in or
none-of-the-above voting is allowed. The polls should be open for a week.</p>

<p>The entire process takes four months. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hal Winchester Canary</strong> <br />
  July 12, 1943 – April 25, 2018</p>

<p>Hal Winchester Canary, 73, of Raleigh, North Carolina, and originally from
  Memphis, Tennessee, died on April 25 at 4:55 p.m.</p>

<p>Hal grew up in Memphis and attended Central High School, where he met his
  future wife, Kathy Carroll. He finished high school at Columbia Military
  Academy in 1961, and received both a Bachelor of Science and a Masters in
  Business Administration at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1966 and
  1970. He then became a Certified Public Accountant.</p>

<p>Hal married Kathy in 1965.</p>

<p>Hal served in the United States Army from 1965 to 1969, in the XVIII Airborne
  Corps, 12th Support Brigade, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, as a First
  Lieutenant, Quartermaster Corps. He received the Army Commendation Medal.</p>

<p>After business school, Hal worked as an accountant at Ernst &amp; Young and Haines
  &amp; Jackson, in Memphis. Hal served as the Finance Director of the City of
  Germantown, Tennessee, from from 1979 to 1990. He received the Government
  Finance Officers Association's Award For Excellence in Municipal Debt
  Management. After leaving Germantown, Hal founded Canary Consulting to provide
  financial advice to businesses and governments. From 1993 to 1994, Hal served
  as Finance Director at the Virginia Beach City Public Schools. In 1996 he
  joined Public Financial Management, where he retired as a Managing Director in
  2009.</p>

<p>Hal and his wife Kathy moved from Memphis to Fort Myers, Florida, in 2000. Hal
  enjoyed sailing and golfing in his retirement. In 2015, Hal and Kathy moved to
  Raleigh to be closer to their grandchildren.</p>

<p>Hal was the Treasurer and a member of the Vestry at Grace-St. Luke's Church in
  Memphis. He was active as adult leader in the Boy Scouts of America. He was a
  member of the American Institute of CPAs, the Society of CPAs, the Florida
  Institute of CPAs, the Government Finance Officers Association, the Tennessee
  GFOA, and the Florida GFOA.</p>

<p>Hal is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Kathy Carroll Canary, his
  sister Lucy Canary Church of Charlottesville, Virginia, his son Hal W. Canary,
  III, of Durham, North Carolina, and two grandchildren, Margaret and Thaddeus
  Canary.</p>

<p>A memorial service was held on May 1, at the Springmoor Retirement Community
  auditorium, in Raleigh.  Hal's ashes were interred at Memorial Park Cemetery in
  Memphis, Tennessee, on July 13.</p>

<p>One may make a donation in Hal’s memory to the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society
  (<a href="http://www.lls.org/">lls.org</a>).</p>

      <p class="byline">time-traveling post-human nanotech robot</p>

<p>[WP] A post-human nanotech robot (PHNR) from the future time-travels to sometime in the first half of the twentieth century. They want to change the world for the better, but sets strict rules on themself to prevent themself from dominating humanity:</p>

<ol>
<li>no disclosing their own existence. </li>
<li>no disclosing information or technology from the future. </li>
<li>no direct involvement in wars or altercations. </li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, PHNR uses tiny unnoticeable nanotechnology to spy on just about evey human on the planet. They feed some small amount of gathered information to appropriate groups. </p>

<p>For example, if PHNR observes a conspiracy to commit a murder, they may choose to send an anonymous letter to the local police so they can attempt to prevent the crime.  If PHNR observes a crime, it can send a tip to the cops describeing the event and where evidence may be found. </p>

<p>PHNR uses this power judiciously: they never snitch on victimless criminals, rarely on minor crimes, never when it would give away too much information about their abilities. PHNR never assists corrupt government officials. They also send tips to journalists occasionally, especially about corrupt politicians and officials. </p>

<p>PHNR interferes in wars to give intelligence to the side it favors, if it favors one side. Otherwise it feeds information to civilian populations to help them avoid bombing and troop movements. </p>

<p>All of the world's librarians should collaborate on a giant electronic archive of humanity's written work.</p>

<p>If our civilization collapses, this archive can provide a somewhat complete record of human knowledge and works for the future.</p>

<p>Copies of the archive would be stored by anyone who wishes to make a copy.</p>

<p>It would be updated continuously, with annual releases.</p>

<p>Books, magazines, newspapers, science journals, scripts, screenplays, laws, public records, written music, letters, pamphlets, transcripts, as well as text published electronicly would be included.</p>

<p>It would primarily consist of plain text documents, (with static images illustrations as needed). Original scans and layout would not be included due to storage limitations.</p>

<p>The archive would consist of public-domain works, as well as works with appropriate free licenses.</p>

<p>I expect that it will be very large, and I hope it inspires new technology for read-only storage.</p>

<p>A city center built in an excavated cavern under the Appalachian mountains. Five miles wide, fifteen miles long, a quarter-mile tall. The roof of the cavern is supported by narrow towers made of super-strong composite material.</p>

<p>The floor of the cavern is covered with tall buildings and parkland, with a street layout reminiscent of Manhattan. The population of the city center is about 3 million.</p>

<p>The walls and ceiling of the cavern are covered with screens that show a perfect stereo image of the sky.</p>

<p>Surrounding this city center are smaller caverns containing suburbs, industry, and agriculture. All are connected by thousands of transportation tunnels that autonomous cars and trucks move through. The total population is around 20 million.</p>

<p>Over time, the city is working towards 100% sustainability, including fully recycling water and air. Power is piped in from a giant floating island in the Atlantic, covered in solar cells.</p>

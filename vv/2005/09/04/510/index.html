<p>Many cities are designed on a Cartesian plan: north-south streets and east-west streets. Madison is on a double-Cartesian plan: N-S, E-W, NW-SE, and NE-SW streets all jumbled together.</p>
<p>If you want to go northeast, it is nice to be able to get there, but it does tend to make the city confusing.</p>
<p>So I've been thinking about other ways of doing it. instead of four and instead of eight direction, how about six? E-W, NW-SE, and NE-SW, where NW is really closer to 60 degrees, not 45 degrees.</p>
<p>You would end up with something that looks like a honeycomb. Then I pull in another idea: If neighborhoods are well-defined, does that make neighborhoods more cohesive? Would it help if I put definite borders between them? Why not space them a bit? Put in parkland to separate them.</p>
<p>Here's the plan:<br /><img src="https://halcanary.org/images/city-grid-2c.png" alt="[city plan]" height="668" width="446" /><br />white = urban (residential/commercial) and high-density suburban zones.<br />dark green = parkland (either wooded or grassy)<br />light green = paved bike and walking paths.<br />heavy black lines = major boulevards (connects neighborhoods)<br />light black lines = avenues (minor streets not pictured)<br />blue lines = mass transit (elevated rail or subway) (connects neighborhoods)</p>
<p>The scale is on the order of one to two miles. This does not take into acount the unique topography of every location. The plan would need to be adapted.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever built a city with mass transit designed in from the beginning?  Is it always an afterthought?</p>
<p>The thing I love the most about this plan is that one could walk from one end of the city to the other and never leave parkland.</p>

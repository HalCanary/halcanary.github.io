<p>The last week... </p>
<p>Last Friday I want to see some really horrible bands, folowed by a good band.  There may or may not have been a ninja attack. </p>
<p>Saturday I worked and avoided the universe. </p>
<p>Sunday I vegged. </p>
<p>Monday was Memorial day.  I went on a 15 mile bike ride, meeting up with J and with S and H for parts of it.  I was in pain by the end of it.  My butt was sore for a couple of days. </p>
<p>I avoided the uiverse for the next few days.  I did manage to visit with friends Wednesday, though. </p>
<p>This week has not been a highly profitable one in the world of pizza delivery.  Something about the first of the month attracts those people who are least likely to tip the driver at all. </p>
<p>Tonight we were over-staffed and I went home early.  I was productive and cleaned a lot of my apartment. </p>
<p>Plans for tommorrow (today):  Up early, clean, bicycle downtown for brunch, stopping at the post office and at the bank on my way.  Stop by the Uni library for some rare  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Smith">Doc Smith</a>  books.  Bike home.  Go to B+N's if time permits.  Go to work.  Overcaffinate myself.  Stay up all night. Work on some schoolwork sunday.</p>

<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<p>Wednesday I stayed up late in a misguided attempt to enjoy my life.  Even thought I only had to be at work by 10am, I was still groggy.  A short nap in the afternoon before the other work didn't help much.  Friday I had to get before 6 and drive to <a href="http://www.wismath.org/GL.html">Green Lake</a>.  As soon as I got back, I went to work.  All day Thursday and all day Friday I was short on sleep.  Not enough to kill anyone, just enough that I was operating at less then 100%.</p>
<p>I just slept for about 10 hours.  Nice.</p>
<p>Today, I'm going to go get the oil changed in the jeep (he's been subtly complaining about his dirty oil for weeks).  Then I'm going to go take advantage of <a href="http://www.freecomicbookday.com/">free comic book day</a>.  At noon it's brunch with the geeks.  Then pre-PBRBQ at Josh's until they call me into work.</p>
<p>I may or may not be going to L+L this evening. I think I'll just throw clean clothes in the truck and put them on after work if the need arises.  I do have a new electric blue tie I want to wear.</p>

<p>Netflix keeps a record of what you've rented.  That makes reviews easier:</p>
<p>===THE YEAR IN RENTAL DVDs 2007===</p>
<p>Hot Fuzz - loved it.  May have to buy it at some point.</p>
<p>Stranger than Fiction - was okay.  Don't need to see it again.</p>
<p>Reign Over Me - liked it.  Kind of depressing, but good.</p>
<p>Black Snake Moan - still can't decide on this one.  It may be a horrible movie, but I watched the whole thing.</p>
<p>300 - eh.  Too full of itself.</p>
<p>Heroes: Season 1: Disc 1 - didn't like it.  Uninteresting characters. No narrative hook.</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - not so good the second time through.</p>
<p>Howl's Moving Castle - very good.  Can't believed I waited iuntil this year to watch it.</p>
<p>Who Killed the Electric Car? - I want an electric car.</p>
<p>Shopgirl - Eh.  Clair Danes needs to play a new charater once in a while.</p>
<p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - don't need to see this one twice.  Was okay.</p>
<p>Children of Men - good movie.  A little depressing.</p>
<p>MirrorMask - okay.</p>
<p>The Queen - okay.</p>
<p>Borat - awful.  Had to send back mostly unwatched.</p>
<p>Running with Scissors - not that interesting.</p>
<p>Seven Years in Tibet - I liked it.  Don't need to see it again.</p>
<p>When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts - well done.  I recomend it.  But don't need to see it again.</p>
<p>Clerks 2 - unnessisary sequil.</p>
<p>The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai - I can't believe I hadn't seen it before.  Wonderful.</p>

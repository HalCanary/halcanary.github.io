<!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
<p>Was reading Gwyneth Cravens' <em>Power to Save the World: The Truth about Nuclear Energy</em> (ISBN 9780307266569) and ran across a couple of interesting things.</p>
<p>Smokers are significantly more likely to absorb radon gas into their lungs than non-smokers.  (Radon can be found in uranium mines, but can easily be flushed out with better ventilation.)</p>
<p>And I like this quote from Rip Anderson:</p>
<blockquote><p>"A nuclear plant that emitted as much radiation as a coal-fired plant would be shut down."</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm still only 50 pages into the book.  It's a lot of basic science that I learned in high school, combined with a lot of facts I didn't know, written by an author who started learning the subject from a state of total ignorance.</p>

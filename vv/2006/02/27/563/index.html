<p>Spent a load of money on my car today.  Battery, belt, &amp; oil.  It's probably all worth it.</p>
<p>I've also decided to reread <a href="http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=050124">&ldquo;Oceans Unmoving&rdquo;</a> because it made no sense the first time through.   It's a good self-contained story. (I'm assuming that it will end in the next week or so.) It reads better as <em>comic book</em> than as a <em>daily comic strip</em>.  The author would also benefit from more editorial input.</p>
<p>This weekend, I watched the first series of <a href="http://www.torrentspy.com/directory/977/tv/it+crowd+%28the%29"><em>The IT Crowd</em></a>.  Some of it was brilliant, and some of it was less so.  The first episode is my current favorite.</p>
<p>I believe that every TV show should have limited runs. Tell your story, do a handful of variations on your theme, then end it. Bringing back <em>Family Guy</em> was probly a mistake; the new episodes don't add much. That said, there are no hard-and-fast rules on how many episodes is enough. <em>FMA</em> tells a single story in fifty-one episodes.  Most sitcoms should be ended after a dozen episodes.</p>

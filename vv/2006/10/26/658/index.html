<p>What all happened to my computer:</p>
<p>1) /dev/hda (formatted with ntfs and vfat for windows) died suddenly.  Made loud clicking noises.  Was many years old anyways.  When were 30GB HDDs still sold?  2001?</p>
<p>2) I yanked /dev/hda from the box.</p>
<p>3) /dev/hdb would no longer boot, cause the MBR that contained Grub lived on /dev/hda.  Used Knoppix and Fedora Rescue CD to access drive.</p>
<p>4) I tried to convence grub to install to /dev/hdb.  I had no luck.  With lilo that would have been easy.  With grub, it's a mystery.  Spent lots of time stairing at the grub> prompt.</p>
<p>5) Gave up on /sbin/grub-install.  Used dd.  dd killed my partition table.  Apparently, the MBR and the partition table live in the same sector.  I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS.</p>
<p>6) Recovered the partition table using gpart (Guess Partitions?)  and some intelegent guesses.</p>
<p>7) Went to the store and bought a new 190 GiB (== 204 GB) hard disk.  Formatted it with an NTFS partition so I can play World of Warcraft when the need takes me.  Left a 142G vFAT partition for cross-OS file transfer and cross-device backups.</p>
<p>8) Installed XP.  Installed basic software and patches.</p>
<p>9) Figured out that I could make a bootable Grub CD by with the /usr/share/grub/i386-redhat/stage2_eltorito file.  CD boots and I get a grub&gt; prompt.  By typing</p>
<pre>grub&gt; root (hd1,0)
grub&gt; kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2200.fc5 ro root=/dev/hdb2
grub&gt; initrd /initrd-2.6.18-1.2200.fc5.img
grub&gt; boot</pre>
<p>I can boot up the functional OS on /dev/hdb.  There is much rejoicing!  So much better than a liveCD.</p>
<p>10) I wait until FC6 comes out, then fire up bittorrent to get it.</p>
<p>11)  I install FC6 on /dev/hdb.  At the same time, FC6 installer writes wotking grub MBR to /dev/hda.  All is well.</p>
<p>Review of FC6 to follow.   </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Thought:  Hard disks tend to last long enough  for something six times as big to replace them.  By which time you won't even miss them.</p>

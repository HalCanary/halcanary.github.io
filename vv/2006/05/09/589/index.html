<blockquote><p><em>If I had a sailing boat, I'd sail away,<br />
Sail the Gulf of Mexico, I'd sail to Charleston Bay.<br />
If I stopped at New Orleans, I'd fish oceans springs.<br />
Sail to the Florida Keys, and I've got friends along the way.<br />
Once I got to Charleston Bay, sail back down again.<br />
Sail down to Mexico, it's just a dream, my friend.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd like to get to know the sea, look up toward the sky.<br />
See full sails.  Feel so down.  I can see it in my mind.<br />
Maybe I'm dreaming, but some times they come true.<br />
And if this one comes for me, well then you're invited too.<br />
But if things should never change,  I know just what I'll do:<br />
Close my eyes and hold you close and I dream my dreams with you.</em></p>
<p><em>But if I had a sailing boat, I'd sail away,<br />

<p>This is me the day I moved to Madison:</p>

<p>When I finally move away, will I look like that again?</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>For my upcoming move this summer, I'll be putting a portion of my possessions in storage. After hearing horror stories of people losing many books and papers to water damage, the plan is to line each box with a large garbage bag before filling it up. This way if there is flood damage, I won't lose everything.</p>
<p>Every possession of mine that I can't throw out will be hermetically sealed into boxes lined with garbage bags.</p>
<p>Everything that I don't need in the next six months goes into a storage unit while I figure out my long-term living situation. As I pack books into box after box, I have this feeling that I might not open these boxes for decades.</p>
<p>Sort of like my own personal time capsule. Cool.</p>

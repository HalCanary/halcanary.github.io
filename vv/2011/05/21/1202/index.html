<p>I had an idea for a beach non&#0045;house several years back but I&#0039;m not sure I ever wrote it down.  Reading about the Dymaxion House reminded me of it.</p>
<p>I enjoy tent living, but dislike leaky tents and damp tent&#0045;floors.  The latter issue can be solved by placing a wall tent on top of a inexpensive wooden platform&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;I lived like that for a summer while working at a summer camp.  The camp had a small building with a real bathroom and laundry facilities.</p>
<p>So the idea I had was a large circular wooden platform on stilts with a solid waterproof roof and a prefab bathroom&#8202;+&#8202;kitchen&#8202;+&#8202;laundry in the center.  Ideally, the platform and roof could be prefab and assembled in place.</p>
<p>The edge of the roof would have canvas walls which could be lowered in the event of heavy rain or a chilly night.  Light rain without accompanying heavy winds could be ignored, since the roof would significantly overhang the platform.</p>
<p>Depending on local conditions,  insect screens or nets may be installed around the edge of the platform.  In that case, the platform will need to be well&#0045;sealed.</p>
<p>The bath is a single room with walls and door, but the kitchen is just a sink, stove, and fridge on one of the outside walls of the bathroom. It is expected that kitchen counters and cabinets would be provided by free&#0045;standing furnature.</p>
<p>Electric outlets are availible both in the kitchen center and under the roof, along with light fixtures and perhaps ceiling fans.</p>
<p>Since there is very little privacy, the idea is to place them in secluded spots in the woods.  It&#0039;s obviously not for everyone, but would be popular with the back&#0045;to&#0045;nature crowd.</p>

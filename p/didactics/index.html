<h2>The Didactics of Hal Canary</h2>

<h3>My Success:</h3>
	<p>(1)<b> Wrap your self in an air of intelligence, knowledge,
	self-assuredness, and sexiness.</b> </p>


<h3>Getting Your Money's Worth Out of Life:  (Part One)</h3>
	<p>(2) <b>Take chances.</b></p>


<h3>Why I Don't Have All of The Answers:</h3>
	<p>(3) <b>It turns out that an essential ingredient in love is
	a tiny pinch of magic.</b>  </p>

<h3>Getting Your Money's Worth Out of Life: (Part Two)</h3>
	<p>(4)<b>Take a big bite out of life. As much as you can get
	in your mouth.</b>  </p>

<h3>The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:</h3>
        <p>(5) <b>A polynomial of n</b><sup><b>th </b></sup><b>degree
        will have n roots.</b> </p>

	<p>Unfortunately, some roots may be doubled or complex.	This
        means that the more complex a problem you have, the more
        solutions you have available to you.</p>

<h3>The Uniqueness Theorem:</h3>
        <p>(6) <b>An n<sup>th</sup> order ordinary
        differential equation with suitable initial conditions 
        (i.e. that specify initial position and initial
        derivatives up to the n-1<sup>th</sup>
        derivative) has a unique solution.</b> </p>

	<p>This implies that the future is completely determined.</p>

        <p>Well, that's misleading. First of all, many real
        systems exhibit chaotic behavior, so unless you can make
        infinitely precise measurements, you can't determine
        future events. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, we're lucky enough to live in a world
        governed by quantum mechanics, so you know it's
        impossible to make arbitrarily precise measurements of
        position and momentum.</p>

<h3>Having Fun, Part One:</h3>
        <p>(7) <b>Even when you're invited, it's more fun to crash 
        a party than to simply attend a one.</b> </p>

<h3>About My Beliefs.</h3>
        <p>(8) <b>I don't "believe" in "truth." </b></p>
